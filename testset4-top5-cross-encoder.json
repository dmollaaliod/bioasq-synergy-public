{"body":"Describe the role of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in COVID-19","type":"summary","id":"5fc7def430a653d77d00000a","answerReady":true,"snippets":["Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a multifunctional transmembrane receptor for ligands that affect 25 developmental axonal growth and angiogenesis. In addition to a role in cancer, NRP-1 is a reported entry point for several viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 . The furin cleavage product of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein takes advantage of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) binding site on NRP-1 which accommodates a polybasic stretch ending in a C-30 terminal arginine. This site has long been a focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer therapeutics. We recently showed that interruption of the VEGF-A\/NRP-1 signaling pathway ameliorates neuropathic pain and hypothesize that interference of this pathway by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interferes with pain signaling. Here, we report hits from a small molecule and natural product screen of nearly 0.5 million compounds targeting the VEGF-A binding site on 35 NRP-1. We identified nine chemical series with lead-or drug-like physico-chemical properties. Using an ELISA, we demonstrate that six compounds disrupt VEGF-A-NRP-1 binding more effectively than EG00229, a known NRP-1 inhibitor. Secondary validation in cells revealed that almost all tested compounds inhibited VEGF-A triggered VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Two compounds displayed robust inhibition of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus protein that 40 utilizes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike for entry and fusion. These compounds represent a first step in a renewed effort to develop small molecule inhibitors of the VEGF-A\/NRP-1 signaling for the treatment of neuropathic pain and cancer with the added potential of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 virus entry. Recent reports have identified additional entry points, including neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) 5, 6 . Neuropilins are cell surface receptors for secreted glycoproteins with roles in neural outgrowth, cardiovascular development, immune response, as well as tumor growth and vascularization 7, 8 . Two neuropilin isoforms, NRP-1 and NRP-2, share ~44% sequence identity in 55 humans and function in different pathways 7, 8 . Both share a modular architecture with three extracellular domains, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Figure 1A ) 9 . The a1a2 modules, homologous to CUB (for complement C1r\/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) domains, interact with semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) to mediate stimulation of growth cone collapse in developing neurons 7 . The b1b2 modules are homologous to the C-terminal domains of blood 60 coagulation Factors V and VIII 7 . The c domain, homologous to meprin, A5, and mu-phosphatase (MAM), was initially thought to be involved in dimerization, but is more likely to contribute to complex assembly by positioning the preceding domains away from the membrane 10 . The single transmembrane helix contributes to homo and heterodimerization 11 and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail is thought to contribute to signaling through synectin, stimulating receptor-65 mediated endocytosis 8 . It is through the b1 module that SARS-CoV-2 may gain entry, by taking advantage of the interaction site for vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A isoforms and other growth factors that terminate in a polybasic stretch ending with an obligatory arginine residue, termed the C-terminal end arginine (CendR) rule 12 , interact with an acidic pocket formed by 70 loops extending from the beta-barrel of b1 ( Figure 1B) 13, 14 . The structure of the heparin binding domain of the 164 residue isoform of VEGF-A (VEGF-A 164 ) confirmed that the C-terminal Arg (Arg164) engages the NRP-1 b1 domain pocket with the guanidine forming a bidentate saltbridge with conserved Asp320 and the carboxylate forming hydrogen bonds to conserved Ser346, Thr349, and Tyr353 ( Figure 1C ) 14 . It is notable that VEGF-A binds to both NRP-1 and 75 NRP-2, but has higher affinity for NRP-1 due to amino acid substitutions within the first loop region of NRP-1 that provide additional contacts between NRP-1 Thr299 and VEGF-A Glu154 (Figure 1B, C) 14 . Furthermore, although b1 and b2 are homologous domains, critical residues within the loops of the binding domain are not conserved with the result that the CendR interaction site is not present on b2. 80 VEGF-A has long been known for its essential role in blood vessel growth and function, but has more recently been shown to be pro-nociceptive 15 . VEGF-A is a selective endothelial cell mitogen that promotes angiogenesis, primarily via interaction with the VEGF receptor VEGFR2, also known as kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) 16 . Alternative splicing of the VEGF-A gene produces several isoforms of the mature protein containing between 121 and 206 85 amino acid residues, with VEGF-A 165 being pro-nociceptive 17 via sensitization of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels 18 and ATP-gated purinergic P2X 2\/3 receptors 19 on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. This alternative splicing is dependent on serine-arginine rich protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) which mediates the phosphorylation of serine-arginine rich splice factor (SRSF1) 17, 20, 21 . VEGF binding to VEGFR2, a co-receptor for NRP-1, is associated with receptor 90 dimerization and activation that triggers downstream signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)\/Akt and phospholipase C gamma\/extracellular signal-indication, we intend to keep compounds in our series such that molecular weight (Mw) < 400 Da, calculated octanol-water partition coefficient (clogP) < 3.5, and calculated solubility (clogS) at pH 7.4 > -5 M. Consequently, we expect the initial absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile of the series to be acceptable (e.g., good hepatocyte clearance and bioavailability). To assess the probability that hit series compounds are orally available, we 160 determined components and overall compliance with Lipinski rule of 5 (Ro5) 65, 66 .

Moreover, in children, increased levels of \u221d2-M are speculated to contribute to the antithrombin activity of plasma and protection against COVID-19, but more studies are All rights reserved.

In the present study, however, \u221d2-M levels were increased in the more severe cases of COVID-19 in all 3 comparisons, which suggests its role in inflammation. Another important role for \u221d2-M, together with \u221d1-AT, also increased in critical patients compared to severe and to mild ones (Tables 4 and 5) , is to control neutrophil elastase, a key enzyme involved in the formation of NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) (36) . Extensive formation of NETs, web-like proteaseand histone-coated DNA structures that constitute an immune mechanism to trap pathogens, is found in severe and critical cases of COVID-19 (37), since they can cause platelet activation and thrombosis (38).","Neurological presentations with COVID-19 were also common, with cases presenting with delirium (12), ischemic stroke (5), intracerebral haemorrhage (2) to the proinflammatory cytokine milieu, inherent to severe disease and reflect a functioning immune system. 16 The binding of COVID-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes release of pro-IL-1\u03b2 which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active IL-1\u03b2 which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. IL-1\u03b2 has been shown to be raised in COVID-19 infection compared to healthy controls by some. 4 This study however does not provide any indication that IL-1\u03b2 levels reflect severity of disease. 4, 17 Despite this, initial trials of the IL-1\u03b2 antagonist Anakinra appear to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in severe cases. 18 However no studies have studied the influence of the drug on pre-and post-treatment levels of IL-1\u03b2, or stratified entry to Anakinra on IL-1\u03b2 levels. Our study would indicate that non-IL-1\u03b2 biomarkers might be of more practical utility.","1 The hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease has been an uncontrolled inflammatory response, resulting from poorly understood immunological dysfunction. We explored the hypothesis that perturbations in FoxP3+ T regulatory cells (Treg), key enforcers of immune homeostasis, contribute to COVID-19 pathology. Cytometric and transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct Treg phenotype in severe COVID-19 patients, with an increase in both Treg proportions and intracellular levels of the lineage-defining transcription factor FoxP3, which correlated with poor outcomes. Accordingly, these Tregs over-expressed a range of suppressive effectors, but also pro-inflammatory molecules like IL32. Most strikingly, they acquired similarity to tumorinfiltrating Tregs, known to suppress local anti-tumor responses. These traits were most marked in acute patients with severe disease, but persisted somewhat in convalescent patients. These results suggest that Tregs may play nefarious roles in COVID-19, via suppressing anti-viral T cell responses during the severe phase of the disease, and\/or via a direct pro-inflammatory role.","Despite the high widespread of COVID-19 contagion worldwide, there is no specific efficient treatment that has been proved till now. Several pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 have been suggested targeting the host's immune response. Following SARS-coV-2 exposure, there is an overproduction of GRP within lung tissue resulting in increased release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, VEGF, GM-CSF and MCP-1. Such cytokines are widely known to enhance neutrophil infiltration which, in turn, induce lung inflammation and respiratory distress as reported in COVID-19 infected patients. As well, cytokines release is also presumed to develop SARS-coV-2 - associated pulmonary fibrosis. Novel findings define COVID-19 as one of the pulmonary diseases associated with endothelial and platelets dysfunction. Now, it is definitely known that viral invasion can be mediated by one of the RAS signaling system components, namely ACE-2. Hence, COVID-19 occurrence and progression can be attributed to imbalance in the pulmonary RAS signaling resulting from SARS-coV-2-induced ACE-2 drain. Interestingly, the decrease in ACE-2 activity will be accompanied with a decrease in the generation of Ang1-7 which was known to be the light side of RAS. Regarding the data emphasized on the protective role of Ang (1-7) in lung injury, it may be recommended as a COVID-19 therapy, but because of its short half-life, Ang (1-7) exhibits a limitation for its use. Since NEP is a more potent alternative way than ACE-2 for producing Ang1-7, it is suggested to assess the possible beneficial role of NEP in COVID-induced lung injury. Few studies have discussed NEP-mediated protective pathways in experimental models of lung injury and fibrosis, however its actual role as a lung protective therapy has not been yet recognized. NEP has been involved in degradation of many peptides that may be incorporated in COVID-19 pathophysiology. So, we expect that NEP can effectively interfere with the chemotactic responsiveness and recruitment of neutrophils by degrading both fMLP peptide and GPR, respectively. Furthermore, we suggest that NEP can minimize cytokine storm associated with SARS-coV-2 invasion through inhibiting Ang II formation by neutrophil-derived Cathepsin G and directing Ang I for generating Ang (1-7) which can in turn suppress TGF-\u03b21 expression and its fibrogenic action, protecting against fibrosis. Degrading both BKs and ET-1 by NEP may be associated with low IL-6 levels, which will be beneficial for stabilizing endothelium and restoring its function. In addition to its catabolic properties, we postulate that NEP may possess an advantage for COVID-19 high risk patients through modulating blood pressure and glucose homeostasis. Practically, numerous in-vivo and in-vitro experimental manipulations were made to upregulate NEP expression either by using drugs (Dexamethasone and Valproic acid), hormones (Androgens and Estrogen) or natural substances (Apigenin, Luteolin, Curcumin and (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate). However, others directed their efforts towards preparing the recombinant NEP (r NEP). Because most pre-clinical and clinical studies within the medical field are interested in studying NEP inhibitors, there is a little data concerning use of NEP as a therapeutic agent. Consequently, its associated adverse effects have not yet been studied well. Finally, we hope our hypothesis will be somewhat enough to direct a future work towards the therapeutic role of NEP in modulating COVID-19 pandemic and to target the subsequent therapies for enhancing NEP activity in COVID-19 patients."]},
{"body":"What Covid-19 viral protein or proteins do the vaccines target?","type":"list","id":"5fdfc9d7ce2471742f000002","answerReady":true,"snippets":["COVID-19, previously known as SARS-CoV-2, targets lung cells by connecting to ACE2 protein.

Extensive efforts and progress have been 18 made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these 19 vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology 20 techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In 21 this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create 22 thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell 23 epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted 24 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes' similarity to human peptides. The 25 presented strategy aims to improve the S protein's immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing 26 stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the protein's native structure and function. The 27 top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell 28 promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven 29 human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell 30 promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The 31 proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigen's 32 structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new 33 COVID-19 vaccine candidates. 34","28 identification of viral-host protein interactions in cellular assays and measurement of host 30 response proteins in COVID-19 patients. Identification of genetic variants that influence the 31 level or activity of these proteins in the host could enable rapid 'in silico' assessment in human 32 genetic studies of their causal relevance as molecular targets for new or repurposed drugs to 33 treat COVID-19. We integrated large-scale genomic and aptamer-based plasma proteomic data 34 from 10,708 individuals to characterize the genetic architecture of 179 host proteins reported 35 to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins or to participate in the host response to COVID-19. We 36 identified 220 host DNA sequence variants acting in cis (MAF 0.01-49.9%) and explaining 0.3-37 70.9% of the variance of 97 of these proteins, including 45 with no previously known protein 38 quantitative trait loci (pQTL) and 38 encoding current drug targets. Systematic characterization 39 of pQTLs across the phenome identified protein-drug-disease links, evidence that putative viral 40 interaction partners such as MARK3 affect immune response, and establish the first link 41 between a recently reported variant for respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients at the ABO 42 locus and hypercoagulation, i.e. maladaptive host response. Our results accelerate the 43 evaluation and prioritization of new drug development programmes and repurposing of trials to 44 prevent, treat or reduce adverse outcomes. Rapid sharing and dynamic and detailed 45 interrogation of results is facilitated through an interactive webserver 46 (https:\/\/omicscience.org\/apps\/covidpgwas\/). 47","The COVID-19 outbreak is an emerging threat across the globe. Despite this, there are currently no permanent antiviral drugs or vaccine reported for fighting this disease. In the present study, we identified immunodominant epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans, using the most comprehensive immunoinformatics approaches. Molecular docking of the immunodominant epitopes with HLA alleles supports their higher binding affinities within different HLA alleles. Further, seven potential immunodominant epitopes were shortlisted based on their higher conservancy, higher global population coverage, and significant interaction to MHC class I and class II alleles with high affinity. These epitopes have a low risk of being allergen, toxic, or generating autoimmune reactions. These finding highlight that these seven immunodominant epitopes could be the potential vaccine targets against SARS-CoV-2. The computational approaches that were used in this study could be a benchmark for the identification of immunodominant epitopes from other emerging pathogens, particularly, coronaviruses, in order to develop potential universal vaccines against various new strains."]},
{"body":"What are the longer-term complications of those who recover from COVID-19?","type":"summary","id":"5fcd276730a653d77d000051","answerReady":false,"snippets":["Some patients who recover from COVID-19 have prolonged symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, cough, and dysosmia for longer than 120 days after symptom onset. In addition, some patients who recovered from COVID-19 reported hair loss a few months after the onset of the disease. Alopecia is a late-onset symptom of COVID-19. The cause of alopecia is unknown, however, androgenic alopecia and telogen effluvium are possible causes.","This study investigated the clinical manifestations, outcomes and longterm complications of COVID-19 inpatients in Bangladesh while emphasizing on individuals having diabetes. A cross-sectional study was conducted for a sample of COVID-19 inpatients across four different hospitals of Bangladesh between April 1st and June 30, 2020. Variation in clinical characteristics, contact history, comorbidities, treatment pattern, and long-term complications were investigated. Results: There were 734 COVID-19 presentations in this study of which 19.8% of patients had diabetes. 76% were male and 85% of the patients had been administered with all vaccine doses during childhood. The most frequently occurring blood groups among patients with diabetes were B (+) ve (35%) and O (+) ve (31%). Among biochemical parameters, glucose, D-dimer, Creactive protein (CRP) and Troponin levels were significantly elevated amidst the cohort with diabetes. The frequency of insulin dependent individuals increased three-fold during COVID-19. A number of COVID-19 patients with diabetes have been suffering from long term complications post recovery including pain, discomfort, memory loss and sleep disturbance. Conclusion: Individuals with diabetes have experienced severe manifestation of COVID-19 and post disease complications. Further in-depth studies focused on larger sample sizes are entailed to assess the relationships elaborately.","COVID-19 has already infected over 27 million people worldwide and has resulted in over 880,000 (figures are current at the time of writing these manuscript) deaths across the globe. This pandemic is nowhere near over or under control yet and continues to actively spread across the U.S. and rest of the world. Though tremendous efforts and resources have been dedicated towards developing a vaccine or a cure, there is yet no effective way to treat this disease. CVD remains the most significant comorbidity associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 infection. While the underlying disease mechanisms are not completely understood, preliminary data suggest that both local and systemic inflammation play a critical role in evoking and potentiating existing or new cardiac functional abnormalities. While myocardial infiltration of immune cells and cardiomyocyte necrosis are short term complications of COVID-19, the long-term effects remain to be seen. These could easily include cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and decreased cardiac output, leading to potentiated cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, patients who recover from severe COVID-19 could be at increased risk of developing HF, and there is a reason and need to continue monitoring these patients for cardiac health issues in the long run. Given the worldwide prevalence of this disease and the strong association with CVDs, additional studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive COVID-19 related cardiac remodeling and to develop effective screening and therapeutic interventions against COVID-19-associated HF in the future.","Patients with cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and an increased mortality. Clinical observations have described cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 in patients without prior cardiovascular disease, including acute cardiac injury, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes. These are also associated with a worse outcome from COVID-19. Several of the potential treatments for COVID-19 may also have cardiovascular consequences. Some of the acute cardiovascular complications resolve on recovery from the infection and it is uncertain how many people will suffer permanent cardiovascular damage. During the emergency lockdown that was introduced to deal with the pandemic it has been observed that hospital admissions with other cardiovascular conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes and heart failure, have been greatly reduced.","A central clinical question as the world deals with the COVID-19 pandemic is what the long-term sequelae for the millions of individuals will be who recover from the hyperinflammatory state characterizing COVID-19 and in particular for the hundreds of thousands who are ill enough to need hospitalization and in particular ICU care. Even when the pandemic is finally controlled, will COVID-19 survivors face exaggerated internal inflammatory processes, worsening co-morbidities, and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases? Clues for what may happen in post-COVID-19 patients can be elicited from those who recovered from other conditions that lead to similar hyperinflammatory states such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm syndrome, and post-ICU syndrome. The short-and long-term sequalae following recovery from each of these conditions suggests that these syndromes lead to an accelerated state of chronic subclinical systemic inflammation often seen in aging (termed inflammaging) resulting in increased and worsening age-related conditions including frailty even in younger individuals."]},
{"body":"Which Covid-19 vaccines were tested in children.","type":"list","id":"5fc9a72c30a653d77d000020","answerReady":true,"snippets":["We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19.","Haematological and immunological data of children with COVID-19 infection is lacking. Between 21 st January and 20 th March 2020, 244 children who were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and admitted to the Wuhan Children's Hospital, China were retrospectively reviewed. 193 children were considered as symptomatic, which was defined as having either the presence of clinical symptoms or the presence of CT thorax abnormalities. Their haematological and immunological profiles, including complete blood counts, lymphocyte subsets (T, B and NK cell counts), immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles (IgG, IgA and IgM) and cytokine profiles were analysed and compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. The median values and the interquartile ranges were calculated. Comparison was made using the Mann-Whitney U test. Children with symptomatic COVID-19 infection had significantly lower haemoglobin levels, but higher absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts, IgG and IgA levels, as well as interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma levels. The obtained data will be utilized for further studies in comparing children and adults with COVID-19 infections in other parts of the world and with different severity.","Of the 1368 children, COVID-19 infection was suspected in 103. Of these, four were previously known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 and there were two new infections. However, 41 of the 1261 children not suspected as having COVID-19 by the EMS were tested for COVID-19 infection at the ED, with only 1 positive result.","Rationale: In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. The initial epidemiological investigations showed that COVID-19 occurred more likely in adults, with patients younger than 10 years old accounting for less than 1% of the total number of confirmed cases, and infant infections were more rare. In our case, we present an infant who was only 35 days old when he was tested positive for COVID-19. Patient concerns: In this report, a 35 day-old male infant with atypical symptoms had close contact with 2 confirmed patients of COVID-19 who were his grandmother and mother. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 after his oropharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Interventions: The therapeutic schedule included aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-2b and supportive therapy. Outcomes: Two consecutive (1 day apart) oropharyngeal swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; then, the patient was discharged on February 27, 2020. Lessons: Strengthening infants' virus screening in families with infected kins is important for early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment when symptoms are atypical. The infectivity of infants with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 should not be ignored because this may be a source of transmission in the community. Abbreviations: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, CT = computed tomography, R0 = basic reproduction number, R T = effective reproduction number, RT-PCR = reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Covid-19 tests are very important, even during the no-symptom phase, according to Song et al. (2020). They observed the Covid-19 transmission in four Chinese families, totalizing 24 persons, with 22 infected. Among those, 20\/22 had mild symptoms, including almost all children, and two presented moderate to severe clinical manifestations. The virus incubation period varied from two to thirteen days, but a period of virus shedding over a month was observed in six cases. Song et al. (2020) showed how Covid-19 spreads within families and observed that adults were more likely to be symptomatic compared to children."]},

It can survive for significant part of time and travel to some distance without losing its viability and virulence and thus pose threat. There is no evidence that viruses alone are airborne and also it remains viable or virulent on particulate matters surface. However particulate samples are tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 gene markers. It has also been found that particulate matters and some other criterion gases pollutants are positively correlated with the number of COVID-19 and cases and mortality caused by them. As far as local meteorology is concerned some of the parameters such as temperature and humidity are negatively correlated i.e. higher the temperature and humidity lesser the number of cases. Rainfall is nothing to do with number of cases while wind speed is positively related with the number of cases.

Of note, up to now asthma has not been specifically and extensively investigated as potential risk factor and few studies clearly report its frequency among the baseline clinical features of COVID-19","Although adult data suggest that asthma is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality such a risk in children is unclear. Differentiating COVID-19 from worsening asthma, or an asthma exacerbation, is challenging. As a result, pediatricians and families have an essential role in ensuring that children with asthma maintain good asthma control during this time.","In conclusion, the evidence we have supports the idea that COVID-19 could have a more pronounced impact on asthmatics and COPD patients compared to those without comorbidities. However, further studies are needed to better elucidate the impact of this new infection on respiratory diseases and to better assess the potential risk for these patients. ","A major limitation of our study is the lack of direct comparison with a COVID-19 non-asthmatic population. Also, due to its retrospective design, some baseline patients' characteristics potentially impacting on the disease outcomes, including asthma subtype baseline blood eosinophil count, IgE level, previous thromboembolic events, information on influenza vaccination, are missing. However our data provide a first asthma prevalence report in a large Italian population of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, confirming that the proportion of asthmatics is very small and suggesting that asthma itself cannot be considered an independent risk factor for COVID 19. On the other side patients with asthma receiving GINA 4\/5 therapy, and those not adequately treated, should be considered at higher risk of worse COVID-19 outcome.","Initial reports of COVID-19 risk show that individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions such as hypertension, asthma, diabetes, and cancer may increase the chances for severe illness and death [15,16,17]. In our county-level study, the preliminary findings suggest a potential association between asthma hospitalization and COVID-19 deaths (%) and potential spatial overlap with COVID-19 incidence at the population-level. Among counties with COVID-19 incidence rates above the state average, 42.1% (n = 8) of counties also had higher rates of asthma hospitalizations. According to National Jewish Health [40], it is possible that COVID-19 may have a greater impact on asthma sufferers, which may experience more severe symptoms. In New York City, 5.0% of COVID-19 patients were also comorbid with asthma [41], although this percentage, thus far, is lower than what researchers expected [42]."]},

'Trained immunity' of the populace as a result of mandatory BCG immunization policy implementation by countries has been suggested as one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning 'trained immunity' has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any correlation. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any mandatory BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations is consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections per million population at all the time points evaluated [r(20): -0.5511 to -0.6338; p-value: 0.0118 to 0.0027]. The results indicate that the on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes should consider the inclusion of 'controls' for underlying 'trained immunity' prevalence or that resulting from the intervention (BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions.","It is vital that routine childhood vaccinations are timely, particularly for diseases such as measles for which a high coverage is required to prevent outbreaks [8, 14] .

COVID-19 badly affects countries that did not have universal immunization policies or having them only for the selective population of countries (highly prominent population) like Italy, USA, UK, Netherland, etc. Universal immunization of BCG can provide great protection against the COVID-19 infection because the BCG vaccine gives broad protection against respiratory infections. BCG vaccine induces expressions of the gene that are involved in the antiviral innate immune response against viral infections with long-term maintenance of BCG vaccine-induced cellular immunity. COVID-19 cases are reported very much less in the countries with universal BCG vaccination policies such as India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Israel, Japan, etc. as compared to without BCG implemented countries such as the USA, Italy, Spain, Canada, UK, etc. BCG vaccine provides protection for 50 to 60 years of immunization, so the elderly population needs to be revaccinated with BCG. Several countries started clinical trials of the BCG vaccine for health care workers and elderly people. BCG can be uses as a prophylactic treatment until the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine.","COVID-19 was declared as pandemic on 11 th March 2020 by WHO. There are apparent dissimilarities in incidence and mortality of COVID-19 cases in different parts of world. Developing countries in Asia and Africa with fragile health system have shown lower incidence and mortality compared to developed countries with superior health system in Europe and America. Most countries in Asia and Africa have national BCG vaccination program while Europe and America do not have such program, or have ceased it. At present, there is no known therapy to treat COVID-19 disease. There is no vaccine available currently to prevent COVID-19 disease. As mathematical modelling is ideal for predicting the rate of disease transmission as well as evaluating efficacy of possible public health prevention measures, we have created a mathematical model with seven compartments to understand nationwide BCG vaccine recommendation on COVID-19 transmission, severity and mortality. We have computed two basic reproduction number, one at vaccine free equilibrium point and other at non-vaccine free equilibrium point and carried out local stability, sensitivity and numerical analysis. Our result showed that individuals with BCG vaccinations have lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection, shorter hospital stays, and increased rate of recovery. Furthermore, countries with long-standing universal BCG vaccination policies have reduced incidence, mortality, and severity of COVID-19. Further research will focus on exploring the immediate benefits of vaccination to healthcare workers and patients as well as benefits of BCG re-vaccination."]},

A global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020. Approximately 30% of infected individuals are asymptomatic. 1 We present the case of a 68-year-old female who underwent outpatient breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for assessment of a right breast mass. The study demonstrated abnormal subpleural high T2 signal intensity change within in the partially visualised lungs, which showed enhancement following administration of contrast. Concern was raised that the pulmonary changes may represent COVID-19 infection. The patient was urgently contacted and denied any current symptoms but reported suffering mild upper respiratory tract symptoms two weeks earlier. An outpatient chest radiograph demonstrated changes consistent with COVID-19 infection and the patient was treated as COVID-19 positive and advised to self-isolate for seven days as per Public Health England guidance. 2 Due to increasing breathlessness the patient presented to our Emergency Department the next day and underwent a CT pulmonary angiogram which demonstrated segmental pulmonary emboli and subpleural consolidation in keeping with COVID-19 infection. This represents the first case of COVID-19 identified on breast MR imaging that the authors have seen and highlights the importance of prompt identification and flagging of incidental pulmonary findings to minimise further transmission of the virus in asymptomatic carriers.","COVID-19 is an emerging disease that can manifest itself as asymptomatic or mild respiratory tract infection in the majority of individuals, but in some, it can progress into severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inflammation is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of severe infections and ARDS and evidence is emerging that the IL-1\/IL-6 pathway is highly upregulated in patients with severe disease. These findings open new avenues for host-directed therapies in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and might in addition to antiviral treatment be enough to curb the currently unacceptably high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.","Background: COVID-19 is a newly emerging disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which spread globally in early 2020. Asymptomatic carriers of the virus contribute to the propagation of this disease, and the existence of asymptomatic infection has caused widespread fear and concern in the control of this pandemic. Methods: In this study, we investigated the origin and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 in Anhui's two clusters, analyzed the role and infectiousness of asymptomatic patients in disease transmission, and characterized the complete spike gene sequences in the Anhui strains. We conducted an epidemiological investigation of two clusters caused by asymptomatic infections sequenced the spike gene of viruses isolated from 12 patients. All cases of the two clusters we investigated had clear contact histories, both from Wuhan, Hubei province. The viruses isolated from two outbreaks in Anhui were found to show a genetically close link to the virus from Wuhan. In addition, new single nucleotide variations were discovered in the spike gene. Conclusions: Both clusters may have resulted from close contact and droplet-spreading and asymptomatic infections were identified as the initial cause. We also analyzed the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and the challenges to the current epidemic to provided information for the development of control strategies.","as not all patients were tested, we are unable to comment on the overall incidence of COViD-19 in our patient cohort and it is important to note that a large number of COViD-19 infections are asymptomatic. Lavezzo et al 27 reported that 42.5% of confirmed COViD-19 infections were asymptomatic across the two nasopharyngeal swabs surveys for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of the italian municipality of Vo'. 27 Given these significant limitations, the the authors would caution against over-interpretation of the findings. However, the results from this small retrospective study appear consistent with CSi likely being low risk for the majority of patients in the setting of COViD-19. 17 the authors believe this study provides helpful information and have found discussion of our findings extremely useful when discussing the potential risk of CSi when obtaining informed patient consent, particularly when contextualised with the current incidence of COViD-19 cases regionally in comparison with the incidence at the peak of the pandemic.","COVID-19 is a new infectious disease that infected more than three million people in many countries all over the world. The severity and clinical manifestation of COVID-19 varies, and some individuals were reported as asymptomatic. Based on the results of this study, many of the COVID-19 infected cases show no symptoms, and that the infection could be transmitted during the incubation period. Consequently, asymptomatic patients are considered carriers and a potential source of infection to the community.

Furthermore, the inactivated vaccine also contains the Alum adjuvant. There are other examples support the superiority of whole inactivated vaccines above those expressing recombinants single antigens. For instance, 7.5 \u03bcg\/dose of the trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine is as safe as, but more immunogenic than the 22.5 \u03bcg\/dose of the recombinant baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin FluBok vaccine, in young children (46).","It should be noted that the development of a COVID-19 vaccine has been on a fast track. Thus far, four non-replicating viral vector vaccines, three inactivated vaccines and two mRNA vaccines being under clinical phase III stage, with more are on the way (32). Though different types of adjuvants have been used in exploratory and pre-clinical studies ( Tables 1 \u2013 3 ), considering the need for rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines for the pandemic, alum, which had been formulated in many other licensed vaccines, have been prioritized (15, 16). In addition to the adjuvants described above, engineered nanomaterials also shed light adjuvant development. It has been shown that physicochemical characteristics of aluminum oxyhydroxide could affect the optimal immunogenicity profiles of vaccine formulations (41, 83, 84). Moreover, a recent study has shown that an alum-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE) showed robust RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG2a titers and a high level of inducing IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells in a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, it has been shown that a natural and potent STING agonist encapsulated by pulmonary biomimetic liposomes triggered rapid humoral and cellular immune responses and exhibited a sustained cross-protection against influenza (76). However, more comprehensive mechanistic studies, including the nature of protective immune responses and screening of the various combinations of antigens and adjuvants, are needed for the successful development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.","The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the ongoing threat of pandemics caused by novel, previously unrecognized, or mutated pathogens with high transmissibility. Currently, vaccine development is too slow for vaccines to be used in the control of emerging pandemics. RNA-based vaccines might be suitable to meet this challenge. The use of an RNA-based delivery mechanism promises fast vaccine development, clinical approval, and production. The simplicity of in vitro transcription of mRNA suggests potential for fast, scalable, and low-cost manufacture. RNA vaccines are safe in theory and have shown acceptable tolerability in first clinical trials. Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in phase 1 trials looks promising, however induction of cellular immunity needs to be confirmed and optimized. Further optimization of RNA vaccine modification and formulation to this end is needed, which may also enable single injection regimens to be achievable. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines, which show high immunogenicity at low doses, might help to improve potency while keeping manufacturing costs low and speed high. With theoretical properties of RNA vaccines looking promising, their clinical efficacy is the key remaining question with regard to their suitability for tackling emerging pandemics. This question might be answered by ongoing efficacy trials of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.","Because MERS-CoV does not have a commercially licensed vaccine, studies to develop the vaccine are still active [24] . In the case of influenza, the vaccine is present, but the inactivated vaccine is less effective than the attenuated vaccine [25] . Generally, protein-based and\/or inactivated vaccines are less immunogenic than attenuated vaccine [25, 26] . Therefore, multiple rounds of inoculation to elicit protective immune responses against a pathogen is a disadvantage. Moreover, because of the relatively short duration of immunity, many studies are underway to improve this feature [27] [28] [29] . A potential solution is the addition of immunological adjuvant to protein-based and\/or inactivated vaccines [25] . Alum has been widely used for a long time [11] but does not strongly induce the Th1 immune response. Additionally, side effects such as autoimmune\/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants also occur, requiring further confirmation of safety [30, 31] . To compensate for these limitations, RNA adjuvants have recently been developed [19] and applied to MERS and influenza, as they did not accumulate in the body, thus lowering the risk of side effects and effectively increasing the immune response [17, 18] . We found that immunization with MERS S protein with RNA adjuvant and alum synergistically induced the humoral immune response and led to balanced Th1\/Th2 responses [17] . However, the immunization routes most suitable for inducing the optimal immune response with RNA adjuvant were unclear. Therefore, in this study, we tested the immune effects of intramuscular, intradermal, and intranasal injection, which are the most popular vaccination routes, with RNA adjuvant in a mouse model.","The results of these on-going clinical trials on new therapeutic options have brought in hope in controlling the spread of novel coronavirus and sufferings of patients with COVID-19. Not only this, the success of such trials may prove the best utilization of the technological advances and their integration with health sciences. RNA and DNA vaccines offer us the potential for more rapid vaccine development because synthetic RNA and DNA are easier to construct and are relatively purified from contaminants (improving safety) with immense potential of scaling up the volume of production in comparison to the traditional vaccines. As mentioned in text, the Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: PSTI) (TASE: PSTI) HAIFA, Israel, working on mesenchymal stem cells for treating COVID-19 patients has shown higher recovery rate and less mortality paving the way to explore this treatment strategy for the large number of patients affected with severe forms of COVID-19 all over the world. MSCs are well known in downgrading the inflammation and activation of Antigen Presenting Cells, but there is no evidence of their role in the activation of B cells and T cells; which is well-known role of DNA and RNA based vaccines, so both MSCs and Nucleic acid based vaccines in a synergistic way or with immune-engineered modification, may produce better results in combating with this virus [32, 33]. Thus utilization of such novel vaccines might be a better way for mitigation of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The finding that mesenchymal stem cells and DNA\/RNA vaccines are safe and can reverse severe critical disease with high potency is a key breakthrough representing an entirely new biological approach to treatment of such deadly viral diseases. Given the pressing needs to keep mortality as low as possible, such treatments need to be researched and developed promptly."]},

Peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by nephelometry. At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells, which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity. This study associates for the first time COVID-19 severity with an imbalanced humoral immune response characterized by excessive consumption of IgG and C4, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.","Humoral immunity plays important roles in antiviral response. In this study, we observed changes in serum levels of immunoglobulin and complements in COVID-19. Patients had more often increased levels of IgG, IgE, and complement C4, but decreased levels of C3 (shown in Table 4). The average levels of the IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C4 showed no significant difference between the two groups. But abnormally higher IgE levels were found to be statistically significant in the T2D group compared with the NDM group. And there were also more patients with an increased level of IgG in the T2D group than in the NDM group. Moreover, serum IgE negatively correlated with Th and B cell counts significantly but positively correlated with neutrophil count (p < 0.05\u2217). In search of the clinical relevance of the immunoglobulin and complements with disease severity, we further conducted univariate logistic regression analysis involving IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, C3, and C4, but none of them indicated statistical significance (data not shown)."]},

We identified seven hypothesized transmission modes based on the three main transmission routes (longrange airborne, close contact, and fomite). The infection risks for each hypothesis were estimated using the multi-agent modeling framework. Least-squares fitting was conducted to compare the distribution of the predicted infection risk in the various scenarios with that of the reported attack rates and to identify the hypotheses with the best fit. In the scenarios in which the index patient was a super-spreader, our model simulations suggested that MERS-CoV probably spread via the long-range airborne route.

Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods and findings: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http:\/\/covidsim.eu\/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and -importantly -some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75% \u2212 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. Conclusions: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.","The world is currently experiencing a new Covid-19 pandemic outbreak by SARS-CoV-2, and the waiting for new or repurposed drugs for the treatment. Though, no drug (except remdesivir) or vaccine has been approved for the Covid-19 disease. Numerous clinical trials are undergoing in the quest to search for the best lead among the repurposed drugs. These drugs belong to diverse classes, which broadly include antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiparasitic, antiprotozoal, antifungal, antibacterial, RAAS-ACE-ARBs inhibitors, and natural products along with other vital classes. These drugs importantly target the virus life cycle at different stages, and some are used as immunomodulators for developed cytokine storm with the progression of Covid-19 disease.

The study included 40 adults who agreed to participate and underwent a mucociliary clearance test successfully. The primary outcome was mucociliary clearance time and the secondary variables of interest were age, sex, and sino-nasal outcome test-22 scores. The control group included 40 concomitant healthy patients who visited the outpatient ear, nose and throat clinic with non-nasal symptoms. The study included 40 COVID-19-positive patients and 40 healthy controls. The mean mucociliary clearance times of the study (15.53 \u00b1 5.57 min) and control (9.50 \u00b1 3.70 min) groups were significantly different (Z = 4.675, p < 0.001).

The present study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of 78 patients with COVID-19 in order to enhance the understanding of the disease. Medical records and data of 78 patients with COVID-19, including demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings and radiological characteristics, were collected and analyzed. Of the 78 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 66.5 years and 48.7% of patients were male. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common chronic underlying diseases, and the most common symptoms were a cough and a fever. Furthermore, the most common findings on the chest CT were extensive ground-glass opacity and bilateral shadowing. Anemia and lymphocytopenia were the most common abnormalities identified during routine blood tests. COVID-19 caused early liver renal damage, with 52.9% of patients displaying elevated D-dimer levels, 98.7% of patients displaying elevated IL-6 levels and 80.8% of patients displaying a reduced level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In the present single-center case study of 78 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, the patients displayed abnormal routine blood tests, liver function, renal function and levels of D-dimer, LDL-C and IL-6.

In the first SAH case, the finding could be attributed to Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy or concurrent extrapontine myelinolysis. The second patient with convexity SAH did not have a history of trauma, coagulopathy, or vascular abnormalities on CT angiography. He underwent a brain CT after slow neurological recovery following a week of sedation and mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 related acute respiratory syndrome, and did not display any other atypical findings that could relate to the SAH.

The log evidence for each of these 32 models was pooled over the 10 countries with the highest reported deaths (listed in Table 2). This evidence accumulation furnishes the marginal likelihood of each period of immunity (i.e., model) that\u2014under uninformative priors over the period of immunity\u2014corresponds to a posterior distribution, having marginalised out conditional uncertainty about all other parameters. Model inversion itself maximises the marginal likelihood that implicitly penalises overfitting, with respect to model complexity 9. The resulting accuracy of the data fits are shown in Figure 3, in terms of cumulative death rates and new cases for the countries considered.","For infant vaccination, 11 of 14 studies assumed 3\u201312 months of vaccine-induced immunity. Cromer et al. [32] set no waning over 5 years, van Boven et al. [31] assumed full protection until the age of 5 years, and Meijboom et al. [30] evaluated no waning, plateau, and linear waning over 10 years. Three studies [20, 24, 29] that evaluated vaccination in the elderly assumed that immunity lasted for one RSV season. Immunity in newborns due to maternal vaccination varied between 3 and 8 months. Additionally, Pan-Ngum et al. [37] and Kinyanjui et al. [33] considered potential interactions between vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity due to maternal antibodies and modelled the effects of infant vaccine given in the presence of maternal antibodies that wane over time.","Following kOCV vaccination with 100% coverage in a population with high migration, we estimate the vaccine-derived DHI to be approximately 0.47 years when R0 = 2, 0.98 years when R0 = 1.5, and 4.06 years when R0 = 1 (Fig 2C, solid lines). These durations increase to 1.07 years, 1.89 years, and 5.16 years, respectively, in the presence of low migration rates instead (Fig 2C, dashed lines). As expected, DHI is reduced when vaccine coverage is less than 100%, and, depending on both the coverage and R0, herd immunity is sometimes unattainable (S4 Fig).","The accompanying distribution over the period of immunity is shown in Figure 4, suggesting that the expected period of immunity is about three months, with fairly precise 90% Bayesian credible intervals (less than the one month resolution of the model search). This does not mean that individuals will suddenly lose immunity after three months, rather that the effective population immunity will decline exponentially with a time constant of about three months. The \u2018effective\u2019 immunity refers to the fact that this characterisation of resilience is conditioned upon the model of aggregated or population dynamics. In other words, the effective population is behaving \u2018as if\u2019 its immunity is lost at this rate. There are many mechanisms that could contribute to this loss; for example, population fluxes could slowly increase the proportion of susceptible individuals (e.g., by relaxing lockdown); thereby diluting immunity acquired by the contagious proportion. Other viral and host factors ( Beutler et al., 2007; Su et al., 2016) may clearly play a role (e.g., viral mutation or loss of antibodies)","Among the other two studies based on the data from Kenya, Pan-Ngum et al. [37] showed that the majority of modelled vaccination profiles with a maximum duration of protection of 6 months resulted in a 7\u201315% reduction in hospitalisations in children aged < 5 years. Poletti et al. [3] modelled the effect of maternal vaccination as an increase of duration of natural immunity in newborns derived from maternal antibodies. Vaccination was assumed to prolong the 4 months of natural maternal protection up to 5, 6, and 8 months. Assuming 8 months of immunity in 100% of protected newborns in the modelled cohort, the authors predicted a 31.5% potential reduction in RSV infant infections."]},

Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, yet limited information is available on risk factors of infection. Methods. We pooled data on occupational surveillance of 10,654 HCW who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in six Italian centers. Information was available on demographics, job title, department of employment, source of exposure, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and COVID-19-related symptoms. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings. The prevalence of infection varied across centers and ranged from 3.0% to 22.0%, being strongly correlated with that of the respective areas. Women were at lower risk of infection compared to men. Fever, cough, dyspnea and malaise were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, together with anosmia and ageusia. No differences in the risk of infection were detected between job titles, or working in a COVID-19 designated department. Reported contact with a patient inside or outside the workplace was a risk factor.","SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with much higher rates of mortality in older people and those with coexisting health disorders. The underlying basis for this is not certain. Cytomegalovirus is a common and persistent herpesvirus infection and the proportion of people that are infected increases with age. Older people who are infected with cytomegalovirus have been shown to display accelerated immune senescence and increased death rates from vascular disease. Cytomegalovirus may act as a negative risk factor for clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection and this could be of importance in relation to clinical management and optimisation of epidemiological control strategy."," SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with much higher rates of mortality in older people and those with coexisting health disorders.

","Our findings suggest that the comorbidity and medication burden present at infection with SARS-CoV-2 could partially affect the outcome of the COVID-19 disease, and that women and men probably share similar but not identical risk factors. Advanced age seems to be the most influencing factor, followed by the presence of various underlying conditions and medications, particularly those related to the cardiovascular system. Nonetheless, much of the mortality seems to be explained by other factors probably related to patients\u00b4clinical management, genetics, and other clinical variables. More research is needed in this field, in different populations and clinical settings, to provide the necessary evidence for the development of early identification strategies for patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes.","Healthcare workers are at increased risk of infection, harm and death from COVID-19. Close and prolonged exposure to individuals infectious with SARS-CoV-2 leads to infection. A person's individual characteristics (age, sex, ethnic and comorbidities) then influence the subsequent risk of COVID-19 leading to hospitalisation or critical care admission or death. While relative risk is often reported as a measure of individual danger, absolute risk is more important and dynamic, particularly in a healthcare setting. Individual risk interacts with exposure and environmental risk factors and the extent of mitigation to determine overall risk. Hospitals create a unique environment in which there is significantly increased risk of infection for all healthcare workers. Anaesthetists and intensivists are at particularly high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients due to their working environments and exposure to certain patient groups. However, the available evidence suggests that the risk for this group of individuals is not currently increased. The review examines factors associated with increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, increasing severity of COVID-19 and death. A risk tool is proposed that includes personal, environmental and mitigating factors, and enables an individualised dynamic 'point of time' risk assessment."]},

Notably, the long incubation period suggests a potential transmission route in tertiary, even asymptomatic, patients. Although lopinavir\/ritonavir and arbidol have been administered in clinical practice, their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication is not yet confirmed (Anon., 2020). Interestingly, the viral load could not be detected early in tertiary patients; thus, it could be speculated that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may gradually decrease.","The SARS-CoV-2 driven disease COVID-19 is pandemic with increasing human and monetary costs. COVID-19 has put an unexpected and inordinate degree of pressure on healthcare systems of strong and fragile countries alike. To launch both containment and mitigation measures, each country requires estimates of COVID-19 incidence as such preparedness allows agencies to plan efficient resource allocation and to design control strategies. Here, we have developed a new adaptive, interacting, and cluster-based mathematical model to predict the granular trajectory of COVID-19. We have analyzed incidence data from three currently afflicted countries of Italy, the United States of America, and India. We show that our approach predicts state-wise COVID-19 spread for each country with reasonable accuracy. We show that R t, as the effective reproduction number, exhibits significant spatial variations in these countries. However, by accounting for the spatial variation of R t in an adaptive fashion, the predictive model provides estimates of the possible asymptomatic and undetected COVID-19 cases, both of which are key contributors in COVID-19 transmission. We have applied our methodology to make detailed predictions for COVID19 incidences at the district and state level in India. Finally, to make the models available to the public at large, we have developed a web-based dashboard, namely \"Predictions and Assessment of Corona Infections and Transmission in India\" (PRACRITI, see http:\/\/pracriti.iitd.ac.in), which provides the detailed R t values and a three-week forecast of COVID cases.","World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 23, 2020, according to WHO, there are 213 countries, areas or territories with COVID-19 positive cases. To effectively address this situation, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics and to concoct efficient control measures to mitigate\/contain the spread. In this work, the COVID-19 dynamics is modelled using susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model with a nonlinear incidence rate. In order to control the transmission, the coefficient of nonlinear incidence function is adopted as the Governmental control input. To adequately understand the COVID-19 dynamics, bifurcation analysis is performed and the effect of varying reproduction number on the COVID-19 transmission is studied. The inadequacy of an open-loop approach in controlling the disease spread is validated via numerical simulations and a robust closed-loop control methodology using sliding mode control is also presented. The proposed SMC strategy could bring the basic reproduction number closer to 1 from an initial value of 2.5, thus limiting the exposed and infected individuals to a controllable threshold value. The model and the proposed control strategy are then compared with real-time data in order to verify its efficacy.","COVID-19 can be transmitted via close contact with infected patients. Regardless of whether the infected individuals are symptomatic, their family members and co-workers are at risk of infection. Viral genomes CGMH-CGU-4 to -7 were obtained from patients who had made contact with an index patient who was infected with the CGMH-CGU-03 strain. CGMH-CGU-03, -05, and -06 genomes were identical and served as the baseline for assessing pairwise genetic distances to the other two cluster members. CGMH-CGU-04 was found to have 3 ORF1ab nucleotide substitutions (A4788G, C10809T, and G21055A); the third position was a non-synonymous change with a G7019S amino acid substitution (Figure 3D). On the other hand, CGMH-CGU-07 showed only one non-synonymous substitution from the baseline at a different ORF1ab position C19547T (S6248L) (Figure 3D). These results suggest that only up to 4 nucleotide changes occurred between CGMH-CGU-04 and -07 genomes within these five Taiwanese clustered infection cases.","Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 has appeared as a unique disease with unconventional tissue and systemic immune features. While COVID-19 severe forms share clinical and laboratory aspects with various pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis or cytokine release syndrome, their exact nature remains unknown. This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of na\u00efve lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe patients. Additionally, our analysis discovered that the strongest association of the patients clinical outcome and immune phenotype is the lung T cell response. We found that patients with a robust CXCR6+ effector memory T cell response have better outcomes. This result is line with the rs11385942 COVID-19 risk allel, which is in proximity to the CXCR6 gene and suggest effector memory T cell are a primary feature in COVID-19 patients. By systemically quantifying the viral landscape in the lung of severe patients, we indeed identified Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1 (HSV-1) as a potential opportunistic virus in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we observed an unexpectedly high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an immuno-compromised patient, allowing us to study the SARS-CoV-2 in-vivo life cycle. The development of myeloid dysfunctions and the impairment of lymphoid arm establish a condition of immune paralysis that supports secondary bacteria and virus infection and can progress to \"immune silence\" in patients facing death."]},

However, it is still debatable whether mandatory wearing of face masks should be undertaken (50, 51). From a public health and safety point of view, it is crucial to continue robust vigilance and implement aggressive control measures to prevent further outbreaks of COVID-19 until complete containment of the pandemic is achieved."]},

There is also no evidence that pregnant women are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 infection or are susceptible to severe pneumonia. Considering the negative results of SARS-COV-2 in samples of umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, breast milk, vaginal mucus, placenta tissue, and neonatal throat swab, there is also no evidence of intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection in the third trimester of pregnancies. It appears that the risk of fetal distress, preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes rises when COVID-19 onsets in the third trimester of pregnancy. Since there are no reports of pregnant patients in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy, the risk of stillbirth and abortion as a result of COVID-19 is obscure and needs to be clarified. Given the impact of similar infections (SARS and MERS) on outcomes of pregnancies in the first and second trimesters, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and neonate outcomes. Overall, due to the lack of information on COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy, all suspected pregnant women should be systematically screened, monitored and followed up. Another issue is whether natural vaginal delivery increases the likelihood of vertical transmission of the infection and if so, the possible mechanisms need to be clarified. Further investigations and follow-up studies of pregnant mothers infected by COVID-19 are warranted.","Background: It has been proposed that pregnant women and their fetuses may be particularly at risk for poor outcomes due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. From the few case series that are available in the literature, women with high risk pregnancies have been associated with higher morbidity. It has been suggested that pregnancy induced immune responses and cardio-vascular changes can exaggerate the course of the COVID-19 infection. Case presentation: A 26-year old Somalian woman (G2P1) presented with a nine-day history of shortness of breath, dry cough, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and fever. A nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Her condition rapidly worsened leading to severe liver and coagulation impairment. An emergency Caesarean section was performed at gestational week 32 + 6 after which the patient made a rapid recovery. Severe COVID-19 promptly improved by the termination of the pregnancy or atypical HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes and Low Platelet Count) exacerbated by concomitant COVID-19 infection could not be ruled out. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. Conclusions: This case adds to the growing body of evidence which raises concerns about the possible negative maternal outcomes of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and advocates for pregnant women to be recognized as a vulnerable group during the current pandemic.","Currently, there are limited data about COVID-19 infections during pregnancy. Some authors reported cases from the 24th week of pregnancy with outcomes generally favourable for both mothers and foetuses. There seems to be no evidence of vertical transmission [12\u201316], but previous experience with infections caused by similar virus such as SARS and MERS, indicates that intra-uterine transmission is not an exclusive cause of foetal morbidity and mortality [14, 19]. There have been adverse outcomes reported in the infants of women with COVID-19, although causality from the infection cannot yet be determined [14, 18]. These include preterm labor and delivery, premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, intrauterine fetal distress, feeding intolerance, asphyxia, pneumonia and respiratory distress, and stillbirth [14]. Moreover, the available literature on possible placental changes and consequences for the course of pregnancy during an infection in gravidate is very limited, even if recent articles reported no increased risk of spontaneous abortion [12].

The severity of systemic illness (and the associated metabolic derangements and inflammatory cascades) in some COVID-19 patients is likely sufficient to cause the toxic-metabolic encephalopathy often seen in hospitalized patients. However, some features of SARS-CoV-2 and specifically the presentation of patients with severe confusional states in the absence of respiratory symptoms or other organ failure, have raised questions about possible alternative mechanisms of CNS injury. Cases of SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis (16) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been recently described (17). Anosmia and ageusia may be early features of SARS-CoV-2 infection (18), implying direct invasion of the olfactory bulb. These revelations have led several investigators to propose multiple potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may induce mental status changes in its victims, including infectious spread to the CNS by retrograde transport or hematogenous spread, dysregulation of cytokine activation leading to CNS inflammation, induction of cell-mediated CNS inflammation, post-infectious autoimmune reactions via molecular mimicry, and hypoxemic\/thrombotic neuronal injury (5,19). Some authors have also hypothesized that hematogenous spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the periventricular system may lead a clinical picture of akinetic mutism even in the absence of a lesion detected on neuroimaging (15).","SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, displaying unprecedented clinical presentations with unique pathophysiology. Here we postulated an immunovascular theory for pulmonary vasculopathy from SARS-CoV-2-mediated ACE2 down-regulation, resulting in vasodilatory signalling loops between ACE2 deficient macrophages, ACE2 deficient vessels, and enhanced AngII signalling, mediated by MIF, TNF\u03b1 and iNOS. While trials are underway targeting these pathways in COVID-19 patients (TNF\u03b1- NCT04425538, MIF- NCT04429555, and Dexamethasone-NCT04381936), we call for further investigation into this phenomenon in hopes of increasing the understanding of COVID-19 and its pathophysiology.","Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public 26 health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease 27 outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including 28 complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions 29 associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical 30 outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with 31 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for 32 complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, 33 and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients -effects 34 that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of 35 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in 36 addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results 37 in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted 38 a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our 39 scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL 40 variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing 41 evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative 42 transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal 43 analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with 44 clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, 45 susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection. : medRxiv preprint 47 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had profound economic, social, and public health impact with over 6.1 48 million confirmed cases and over 370,000 deaths across the globe. The infection causes respiratory illness 49 with symptoms ranging from cough and fever to difficulty breathing. While highly variable age-50 dependent mortality rates have been widely reported, the comorbidities that drive this dependence are not 51 fully understood. Further, with some notable exceptions 1-3 , molecular studies have largely focused on 52 ACE-2, the receptor and determinant of cell entry and viral replication 3 . While ACE-2 expression is 53 critical, viruses employ a wide range of molecular strategies to infect cells, avoid detection, and 54 proliferate. In addition, viral replication and immune mediated pathology are the primary drivers of 55 morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection 4,5 . Therefore, understanding how virus-56 host interactions manifest as SARS-CoV-2 risk factors will facilitate clinical management, choice of 57 therapeutic interventions, and setting of appropriate social and public health measures. 58 59 Knowledge of the precise molecular interactions that control viral replicative cycles can delineate 60 regulatory programs that mediate immune pathology associated with infection and provide valuable clues 61 about disease determinants. For example, viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, deploy an array of genetically 62 encoded strategies to co-opt host machinery. Among the strategies, viruses encode multifunctional 63 proteins that harness or disrupt cellular functions, including nucleic acid metabolism and modulation of 64 immune responses, through protein-protein interactions and molecular mimicry -structural similarity 65 between viral and host proteins (for a full discussion please see accompanying paper). Recently, we 66 employed protein structure modeling to systematically chart interactions across all human infecting 67 viruses 6 and in an accompanying paper, performed a virome-wide scan for molecular mimics. This 68 analysis points to broad diversification of strategies deployed by human infecting viruses and identifies 69 biological processes that underlie human disease. Of particular interest, we mapped over 140 cellular 70 proteins that are mimicked by coronaviruses (CoV). Among these, we identified components of the 71 complement and coagulation pathways as targets of structural mimicry across all CoV strains (see 72 companion paper). 73 74 Through activation of one of three cascades, (i) the classical pathway triggered by an antibody-antigen 75 complex, (ii) the alternative pathway triggered by binding to a host cell or pathogen surface, and (iii) the 76 lectin pathway triggered by polysaccharides on microbial surfaces, the complement system is a critical 77 regulator of host defense against pathogens including viruses 7 . When dysregulated by germline variants or 78 acquired through age-related effects or excessive acute and chronic tissue damage, complement activation 79 can contribute to pathologies mediated by inflammation 7-9 . Similarly, inflammation-induced coagulatory : medRxiv preprint 4 programs --which themselves can be regulated by the complement system --as well as crosstalk between 81 pro-inflammatory cytokines and the coagulative and anticoagulant pathways play pivotal roles in 82 controlling pathogenesis associated with infections. Therefore, while the age-related differences in 83 susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 are likely a consequence of multiple underlying variables, virally encoded 84 structural mimics of complement and coagulation pathway components may contribute to CoV associated 85 immune mediated pathology. Moreover, a corollary of these observations is that dysfunctions associated 86 with complement and\/or coagulation may impact clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For 87 example, the companion study suggests that coagulation disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, thrombosis 88 and hemorrhage, may represent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcome. Among complement-89 associated disorders, multiple genetic and experimental evidence (including animal models of disease, 90 histological examination of affected tissue, and germline mutational analysis) point to dysregulation of 91 the complement system as the major driver of both early-onset, and age-related macular degeneration 92 (AMD) 8-11 . A hyperinflammatory phenotype mediated by complement leads to progressive immune-93 mediated deterioration of the central retina. While AMD, the leading cause of blindness in elderly 94 individuals (affecting roughly 200 million people worldwide 11 ), is likely the result of multiple 95 pathological processes, dysregulation of complement activation has emerged as the most widely accepted 96 cause of disease 9-12 . 97 98 To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems 99 impact adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a retrospective 100 observational study of 11,116 patients at New York-Presbyterian\/Columbia University Irving Medical 101 Center. In agreement with previous reports 13 , survival analysis identified significant risk of mechanical 102 respiration and mortality associated with age and sex, as well as history of hypertension, obesity, type 2 103 diabetes (T2D), and coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, we found that patients with history of 104 macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and coagulation disorders (i.e. 105 thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) were at significantly increased risk of adverse clinical 106 outcomes (including mechanical respiration and death) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, 107 these effects could not be explained by either age or sex, nor did we find any evidence that history of 108 smoking contributes to risk of adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, albeit in a small number of individuals, we observed that no patients with complement 110 deficiency disorders required mechanical respiration or succumbed to their illness. In addition, 111 transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected 112 patients demonstrates that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory","SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection is associated, alongside with lung infection and respiratory disease, to cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs at any stage of the disease. This includes ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathies. The common pathophysiological link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cardiovascular events is represented by coagulation abnormalities and disruption of factors released by endothelial cells, which contribute in maintaining the blood vessels into an anti-thrombotic state. Thus, early alteration of the functionality of endothelial cells, which may be found soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection, seems to represent the major target of a SARS CoV-2 disease state and accounts for the systemic vascular dysfunction that leads to a detrimental effect in terms of hospitalization and death accompanying the disease. In particular, the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located in the endothelial cell surface, either at the pulmonary and systemic level, leads to early impairment of endothelial function, which, in turn, is followed by vascular inflammation and thrombosis of peripheral blood vessels. This highlights systemic hypoxia and further aggravates the vicious circle that compromises the development of the disease, leading to irreversible tissue damage and death of people with SARS CoV-2 infection. The review aims to assess some recent advances to define the crucial role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of vascular complications accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, the molecular mechanisms associated with the interaction of SARS CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor located on the endothelial cells are highlighted to support its role in compromising endothelial cell functionality. Finally, the consequences of endothelial dysfunction in enhancing pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are assessed in order to identify early therapeutic interventions able to reduce the impact of the disease in high-risk patients.","Severe COVID-19 cases involve hemostatic abnormalities that mimic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy associated with sepsis, with the major difference being increased risk of thrombosis rather than bleeding. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with platelet hyperreactivity which may contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology. Increased platelet activation and aggregation could partially be attributed to enhanced MAPK pathway activation and thromboxane generation. Furthermore, platelets from COVID-19 patients showed increased spreading on both fibrinogen and collagen [15] ."]},

By contrast, the US has reserved little more than two doses, or one course, per person, and low to middle income countries such as Brazil and Indonesia have reserved less than one course for every two people. As high income countries have locked in vaccine doses, a growing number of premarket purchase commitments have been directed to populations of low and middle income countries. Though earlier deals were agreed bilaterally between vaccine companies and high income countries, recent purchases have focused more on low and middle income countries. For example, over the past few months Russia\u2019s Gamaleya Research Institute signed nine deals for premarket purchase commitments\u2014all for low and middle income countries.","The copyright holder for this preprint (which this version posted May 9, 2020. . https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2020.05.05.20091975 doi: medRxiv preprint Western Europe has a complex history of BCG vaccination, ranging from Finland, which had a universal vaccination program for 65 years initiated in 1941, to other countries like Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, which have never had universal BCG vaccination (Fig. 4B) .

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated as 1.37 x 10 -3 and 2.19 x 10 -3 substitution\/site\/year, respectively. In conclusion, results from this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential features of viral emergence.

Article time characterization of the evolutionary rate of S protein, crucial for vaccine development.","The global mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.5 nucleotides\/month, but these SARS-CoV-2 genomes had lower than expected mutational rates, fewer mutations than would have been attributed to mutational rate of 2.5 (10 mutations by March and 15 mutations by June) (Figure 4). High rates of mutations usually correlate with high rates of transmission since mutations that persist tend to be important for viral adaptation. All (100%) of Ghanaian SARS-CoV-2 genomes had <13 mutations: 1 sequence had 12 mutations, 4 had 11 mutations, 10 had 10 mutations, and 34 had less than 9 mutations (Figure 4, Supplementary Table 3). Most genomes (86.6%) in the first batch had lower than nine mutations. However, the genome with the highest mutations (12), was Ghana\/1622_S2\/2020 one of the earliest imported cases in batch 1 (Figure 5). This isolate was from a patient who had arrived in the country from the United States and transited through the United Kingdom (UK) and Dubai. The mutational profile of this case clustered very closely with United States, Europe, and Asian samples (Figure 5). This patient exhibited severe disease at the time of sampling and was under ventilation, though currently, disease outcome is unknown. Another sample from the first batch, Ghana\/2828_S6\/2020, had 10 mutations. Both of these viruses were expected to be highly transmissible (based on mutational profile); however, these genotypes were not detected in the batch two samples (Supplementary Table 3).","The estimated mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.4 \u00d7 10\u2212 3\/site\/year with 95% highest posterior density (HPD) of 1.5\u20133.3 \u00d7 10\u2212 3\/site\/year. The mutation rate at the third codon position is 2.9 \u00d7 10\u2212 3\/site\/year (95% HPD 1.8\u20134.0 \u00d7 10\u2212 3\/site\/year), which is in a good agreement with synonymous mutation rate of SARS-CoV, 1.67\u20134.67 \u00d7 10\u2212 3 \/site\/year [34]. SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have originated on 12\/11\/2019 (95% HPD 11\/13\/2019\u201312\/23\/2019). The initial effective population size of the virus was small, which is consistent with the recent origin of SARS-CoV-2. The population size showed approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of Wuhan (1\/23\/2020) and ceased to increase afterwards, demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing on preventing virus spread (Fig. 4). We have to point out that the TMRCA and epidemic growth curve estimation are strongly influenced by the sampling scheme. For example, since the earliest available genome was sampled on 12\/24\/2019 almost 1 month after the outbreak, the real origin of the current outbreak may actually be earlier than our estimation. In addition, all sequences from Wuhan were sampled before 01\/05\/2020 which would have an influence on demographic estimation. ","Once we reconstructed the phylodynamic of SARS-CoV-2 isolates obtained early during the pandemic event, we attempted to determine which nucleotide positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were related to the early divergence of this virus. Overall, the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is 1.15 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions\/site\/year (95% HPD 7.41 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20131.57 \u00d7 10\u22123), while pairwise analysis at nucleotide and amino acid levels revealed an average identity of 99.93\u201399.98% and 99.86\u201399.97%, respectively. Given the short divergence time, a high level of identity is to be expected; however, a few synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were observed in the ORF1ab, S, OFR3a M, ORF8, N, and OFR10 genes (Figures 3A,B). When pairwise distances were calculated based on gene length, the highest levels of divergence were observed within genes ORF10 and ORF8 when considering synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, respectively (Figures 3C,D).","We first explored the evolutionary dynamics of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in China. We used a Bayesian phylodynamic approach (19) that reconstructed the underlying coalescent processes for 583 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes, sampled in China between when the virus was first discovered at the end of December 2019 and the last of the non-reintroduced circulating virus in April 2020. Applying a strict molecular clock, we inferred an evolutionary rate of 7.90\u00d710\u22124 substitutions\/site\/year (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 6.64\u00d710\u22124\u20139.27\u00d710\u22124).

We also did not identify any recurrent mutations statistically significantly associated with reduced viral transmissibility for the more stringently masked alignment. Instead, the entire set of 185 recurrent mutations seem to fit the expectation for neutral evolution with respect to transmissibility, with a mean and median overall log10RoHO score of \u22120.001 and \u22120.02, respectively. Moreover, the distribution of individual site-specific RoHO scores is symmetrically distributed around 0 with 97\/185 mean positive values and 88\/185 negative ones. To summarise, we would expect that recurrent mutations should be the best candidates for putative adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to its novel human host. However, none of the recurrent mutations in circulation to date shows evidence of being associated with viral transmissibility.","SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated frequent mutations since it was first recognized in December of 2019, evolving into two different strains (designated L and S), suggesting a possible propensity to develop subtypes that could result in seasonal variability and lack of immunity to the new strains for those exposed to the previous strains [21]. To date, the differences in the two strains appear to be related to infectivity and the impact on conferred immunity is not clear. In the setting of this rapidly expanding pandemic, a significant number of severely ill patients, and unclear transmissibility in blood, experts are advising caution. Even though a mere month has passed since the article by Drs. Dodd and Stramer were published, it is becoming clear that deferment is becoming increasing untenable as a strategy to address the risk (6). Pathogen reduction may be the only viable solution to protect the blood supply during this crisis.","In conclusion, the incidence of recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test in the patients with COVID-19 after discharge is relatively low and these patients have virtually no symptoms. However, considering the possible potential infectivity, we believe that the current national guidelines may need to be further revised, especially those with recurrent positive results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA test. Furthermore, it could be particularly necessary to increase the isolation observation time and RT-PCR tests should be timely performed on multiple samples as soon as possible. Additionally, we should pay more attention to genome sequencing in order to identify whether the patient is reinfected or relapsed. Considering the patients' underlying disease, personalized treatment should be taken to treat recurrent positive patients with COVID-19.","In conclusion, the incidence of recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test in the patients with COVID-19 after discharge is relatively low and these patients have virtually no symptoms.

The reason for the recurrent positivity of the test and the potential public health concern due to this occurrence are still unknown. Here, we analyzed the viral data and clinical manifestations of 289 domestic Chinese COVID-19 patients and found that 21 individuals (7.3%) were readmitted for hospitalization after detection of SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. First, we experimentally confirmed that the virus was involved in the initial infection and was not a secondary infection. In positive retests, the virus was usually found in anal samples (15 of 21, 71.4%). Through analysis of the intracellular viral subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA), we verified that positive retest patients had active viral replication in their gastrointestinal tracts (3 of 16 patients, 18.7%) but not in their respiratory tracts. Then, we found that viral persistence was not associated with high viral titers, delayed viral clearance, old age, or more severe clinical symptoms during the first hospitalization. In contrast, viral rebound was associated with significantly lower levels of and slower generation of viral receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA and IgG antibodies. Our study demonstrated that the positive retest patients failed to create a robust protective humoral immune response, which might result in SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly in active viral shedding. Further exploration of the mechanism underlying the rebound in SARS-CoV-2 in this population will be crucial for preventing virus spread and developing effective vaccines."]},

However, their development and deployment in epidemic settings have been limited, and the 2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa identified several bottlenecks linked to a lack of investment in pathogen research, infrastructure or regulation. Shortly after this outbreak, the UK Government established the UK Vaccine Network to ensure the UK is better prepared to respond to pathogens outbreaks of epidemic potential. As part of their work, the network commissioned the creation of a Vaccine Development Tool (http:\/\/www.vaccinedevelopment.org.uk\/) to serve as a guide to the key stages in vaccine development. The tool also set out to capture the key, rate-limiting bottlenecks in the development of vaccines against emerging infectious disease such that corrective action could be taken, be it through research, funding, infrastructure and policy, both in the UK and internationally. The main research bottlenecks were related to understanding pathogen biology, identification of appropriate animal models and investment in the manufacturing sciences, especially into process development. Infrastructure gaps in GMP manufacturing and fill-finish were also identified and limitations in GMO regulation and regulatory and ethical approvals, especially for outbreak pathogens required new policy initiatives. The UK Vaccine Network has since begun work to correct for these limitations with a series of funding calls and development programmes. This paper seeks to summarise the Vaccine Development Tool and its key findings.","To overcome these limits next-generation vaccine platforms have been used for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. At present, 2 RNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2-Pfizer\/BioNTech and mRNA-1273-Moderna) have been approved by FDA and EMA. This is the first time RNA-based vaccines produced with next-generation platforms have been approved for human. The approvals were based on the positive results obtained in two randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the safety after a median follow-up of 2 months and efficacy 7 days and 14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines in 18556 and 14134 subjects in the per-protocol analysis, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f respectively (Baden et al., 2020; Polack et al., 2020) . These vaccines conferred 95% and 94.1% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 disease, respectively. The introduction of new technologies in the vaccines' development and manufacturing during COVID-19 pandemic could have permanently globally changed the capability of rapidly counteracting other novel emerging viruses.","There are over a hundred vaccines being developed throughout the world, and the race to be the first effective vaccine has fueled the rapid development of both preclinical and currently utilized vaccine approaches. There is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution as each vaccine strategy has both advantages and disadvantages. Of the leading companies, Moderna, BioNTech\/Pfizer, and Inovio are producing nucleic acid based vaccines, and early studies from Moderna and BioNTech\/Pfizer generated strong antibody. Ad-based vaccines remain early frontrunners as well, with Oxford\/Astrazeneca and CanSino likewise publishing favorable early data. Other state-run institutions and companies such as the Gamaleya Research Institute and Sinopharm have advanced further into their respective Phases of clinical trials and have been granted emergency use by their respective countries. Due to the generation of so many vaccines within many different countries, there will potentially be more than one effective vaccine, and it is crucial that effective vaccines are distributed to all parts of the world to generate global herd immunity. Regardless of the first developer, it is of truly noteworthy importance that the global effort to develop, test, produce, and distribute effective vaccines is being done so rapidly. Success in this effort will not only lead to an end to the pandemic, but what is learned will aid in future research and development efforts as well as the implementation of previously unused vaccine types for future diseases.","The process mapping tool emphasises the importance of ethical and regulatory considerations throughout the entire process, as the iterative workshops continually highlighted the importance of early engagement so the appropriate advice and input shape the R&D. The tool provides an overview and signposting to other organisations and information sources, as many outbreak vaccines may never go through market authorisation due to there being no commercial incentive for the manufacturers. Nevertheless, there will be several stages where necessary approvals must be obtained in order to proceed with developing and testing a candidate. For regular marketing authorization in the EU, vaccine developers must provide a full development dataset of pre-clinical and clinical trial results to evidence Clinical Safety and Efficacy, as well as evaluation of a positive benefit-risk ratio. The mapping tool highlights that:\u2022To discuss the TPP the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) can be approached at any time.\u2022Animal work is regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA). A UK Government Home Office licensure must be provided at an institutional, personal and project level.\u2022The use of GMO vaccines is regulated by separate legislation, and approval must be given by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).\u2022To carry out experimental medicine studies of immune responses in humans the Health Research Authority (HRA) provides ethical approvals through the Research Ethics Service (RES) for projects in the NHS (led from England).\u2022Clinical Trial Authorisation (CTA) is made through a formal application to the MHRA. Trialists must provide information on the mode of action, nature of the target, animal model studies and an IMP dossier with preclinical toxicology data, and any human mechanistic\/proof of concept studies. ","Clinical study results for the COVID-19 GBVs outlined in this paper demonstrate a good immunization profile and for some, very high efficacy. However, further trials to analyze the efficacy and safety in high-risk groups are needed. So far, two COVID-19 viral vector vaccines J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f were approved in their countries of origin. The Ad5-nCoV was approved by the Chinese government for use in their armed forces, in addition to Gam-COVID-Vac by the Ministry of Health of Russia for emergency use authorization. Furthermore, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have submitted data to regulators around the world for the approval of the AZD1222 viral vector vaccine. None of the COVID-19 DNA vaccines have published their Phase I clinical trial results or have been approved. BNT16b2 (BioNTech\/Fosun Pharma\/Pfizer) is the first ever RNA vaccine authorized by the U.S. FDA for the prevention of an infectious disease. A week after, the mRNA-1237 vaccine (Moderna Therapeutics\/NIAID) was also authorized by the U.S FDA for emergency use. This could promote a new era for such novel technology."]},

We checked whether this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins (Figure 1a); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b). We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data (Figure S1). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/mers-cov\/en\/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004. ","Children with COVID-19 were less symptomatic and had more favorable hematological findings than children with SARS. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the betacoronavirus genus and are phylogenetically related to bat SARS-like coronavirus, but relatively more distantly to MERS-CoV. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 79% genetic similarity 3 . They also share similar infection pathophysiology in humans, as they both bind to the same human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into host cells. However, SARS-CoV-2 has higher transmissibility, with a higher reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2-2.5 compared with 1.7-1.9 for SARS-CoV. 4 Studies from Wuhan describing the clinical characteristics of 171 COVID-19 children showed that 15.8% of patients in their cohort were asymptomatic carriers, and only one patient required intensive care with ventilator support. 5 In contrast, previous studies summarizing the clinical characteristics of pediatric SARS patients showed they were almost all symptomatic. 4 A serological study showed that asymptomatic SARS cases in children was rare. 6 Furthermore, compared with other coronavirus infections that cause milder diseases, both SARS and COVID-19 have significantly higher morbidity and mortality. 7 Nevertheless, studies providing a direct comparison of clinical and laboratory features between children infected with SARS and COVID-19 are lacking. In this study, we investigated the clinical and laboratory features in two representative Chinese pediatric cohorts with SARS and COVID-19.

Dyspnea, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms could help differential diagnosis.","A notable feature of the COVID-19 pandemic is that children are less at risk of becoming infected or, if infected, less likely to become seriously unwell, so ethical discussions have consequently focused on the adult healthcare setting. However, despite a lower risk of children becoming acutely ill with COVID-19, there nevertheless may be significant and potentially sustained effects of COVID-19 on the physical, psychological, and emotional health and well-being of children. Focusing on the context of children's cancer care, and specifically bone marrow transplant (BMT), we describe some of these effects and then address one specific ethical challenge that arises. That is the question of what and how much to tell children whose cancer Bioethical Inquiry treatment has been changed because of COVID-19. Drawing on our previous work on the ethical reasons for telling the truth to younger children (aged 5-12) we link different ethical reasons to the different types of information that could be given to children in this context. We argue that children should be given an explanation of the changes that they will directly experience, including some changes to the process of their actual medical treatment; but not about increased risk associated with these changes, unless they specifically ask for this information."]},

Evidence-based public health measures to reduce viral spread include-personal isolation, physical distancing, wearing facial masks, frequent hand washing with soap and running water, not touching the face, vaccination, etc. However once infected, recovery relies on host immunity to eradicate the foreign invaders, with symptomatic management, which is the core management strategy in COVID-19 management guidelines. Researchers have observed that severe COVID-19 prevalence and mortality is highest in people with preexisting conditions. Eighty percent of these preexisting diseases are lifestyle related. Also,","To date, there is no licensed treatment or approved vaccine to combat the coronavirus disease of 2019 , and the number of new cases and mortality multiplies every day. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective treatment strategy to control the virus spread and prevent the disease. Here, we summarized the therapeutic approaches that are used to treat this infection. Although it seems that antiviral drugs are effective in improving clinical manifestation, there is no definite treatment protocol. Lymphocytopenia, excessive inflammation, and cytokine storm followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome are still unsolved issues causing the severity of this disease. Therefore, immune response modulation and inflammation management can be considered as an essential step. There is no doubt that more studies are required to clarify immunopathogenesis and immune response; however, new therapeutic approaches including mesenchymal stromal cell and immune cell therapy showed inspiring results.","Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 , unprecedented movement restrictions and social distancing measures have been implemented worldwide. The socioeconomic repercussions have fueled calls to lift these measures. In the absence of population-wide restrictions, isolation of infected individuals is key to curtailing transmission. However, the effectiveness of symptom-based isolation in preventing a resurgence depends on the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We evaluate the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission based on recent individuallevel data regarding infectiousness prior to symptom onset and the asymptomatic proportion among all infections. We found that the majority of incidences may be attributable to silent transmission from a combination of the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections. Consequently, even if all symptomatic cases are isolated, a vast outbreak may nonetheless unfold. We further quantified the effect of isolating silent infections in addition to symptomatic cases, finding that over one-third of silent infections must be isolated to suppress a future outbreak below 1% of the population. Our results indicate that symptom-based isolation must be supplemented by rapid contact tracing and testing that identifies asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, in order to safely lift current restrictions and minimize the risk of resurgence. COVID-19 | contact tracing | case isolation M any countries, including the United States, are struggling to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. Understanding how silent infections that are in the presymptomatic phase or asymptomatic contribute to transmission will be fundamental to the success of postlockdown control strategies. The effectiveness of symptom-based interventions depends on the fraction of infections that are asymptomatic, the infectiousness of those asymptomatic cases, and the duration and infectiousness of the presymptomatic phase. Empirical studies have indicated that individuals may be most infectious during the presymptomatic phase (1), an unusual characteristic for a respiratory infection. To quantify the population-level contribution of silent transmission to COVID-19 spread, we extended our previous model (2, 3) to include asymptomatic infections and the presymptomatic stage, parameterized with data regarding the trajectory of symptom onset and the proportion of secondary cases generated in each stage of infection (1, 4). As empirical studies indicate that asymptomatic infections account for 17.9 to 30.8% of all infections (5, 6), for both of these values, we quantified the proportion of the attack rate attributable to transmission during presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic stages. Furthermore, this quantification was combined with a series of scenario analyses to identify the level of isolation required for symptomatic or silently infected individuals, to suppress the attack rate below 1%. Our results highlight the role of silent transmission as the primary driver of COVID-19 outbreaks and underscore the need for mitigation strategies, such as contact tracing, that detect and isolate infectious individuals prior to the onset of symptoms. Translating clinical data on infectiousness and symptoms (1) to population-level epidemiological impact, our results indicate that the majority of transmission is attributable to people who are not exhibiting symptoms, either because they are still in the presymptomatic stage or the infection is asymptomatic (Fig. 1) . Specifically, if 17.9% of infections are asymptomatic (5), we found that the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections account for 48% and 3.4% of transmission, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Considering a greater asymptomatic proportion of 30.8% reported in another empirical study (6), the presymptomatic phase and asymptomatic infections account for 47% and 6.6% of transmission, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Consequently, even immediate isolation of all symptomatic cases is insufficient to achieve control (Fig. 1) . Specifically, mean attack rates remain above 25% of the population when 17.9% of infections are asymptomatic and above 28% when 30.8% of infectious are asymptomatic. Given the inadequacy of symptom-based isolation to control COVID-19 outbreaks, we considered the synergistic impact of isolation for presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Combined with case isolation, our results indicate that 33% and 42% detection and isolation of silent infections would be needed to suppress the attack rate below 1%, for asymptomatic proportions of 17.9% and 30.8%, respectively (Fig. 1C ). Our results indicate that silent disease transmission during the presymptomatic and asymptomatic stages are responsible for more than 50% of the overall attack rate in COVID-19 outbreaks.","The solutions suggested by participants to curb the spread of coronavirus include wearing masks properly, maintaining social distance, avoiding maximum gatherings at religious places, crowded places, malls, theatres, etc., adopting personal hygiene, frequent hand washing, staying at home and breaking the chain, consulting the doctor if any symptoms appear. The government should have facilities available for proper quarantine for immediate contacts, strict action must be taken against offenders and vaccinations are required as soon as possible.","With only slight exaggeration, and unfortunately, it may be said that a similar situation applies to the effect that the large number of slum dwellers can have on supply of those infected by the coronavirus, at least until a vaccine is found. Without assistance, and if they act only as individuals rather than as communities, they will be ravaged, and in their attempts to flee from their disease-burdened locations, the virus will continue to spread [34] . Thus, the population of these communities present two high quality targets-densely populated locations as well as large numbers of people who cannot isolate themselves because they have to work in order to live and because they live in such crowded conditions. Targeting assistance on them makes macroeconomic sense as well as providing distributional justice."]},

This experience has led -over time-to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8\u00b0C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 \u00b0C be considered. In confronting this \"perfect storm\" of Covid-19 vaccine stability challenges, understanding the many lessons learned from decades of development and manufacturing of live virus-based vaccines is the shortest path for finding promising and rapid solutions.

The available data suggest that COVID-19 requires particular conditions to be transmitted through the air (such as AGPs), leaning toward the effectiveness of surgical face masks in most circumstances. High viral loads found in toilets and\/or bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways argue for a careful consideration of these areas for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. However, the presence of viable viruses should be primarily considered, given that it is a required link for the potential of cross-transmission.","To evaluate our blockchain based system we considered a setup for the COVID-19 vaccine using the rules for safe the transportation and storage presented in [10]. We have considered that the distribution company delivers the vaccine lots to the interested medical care unit, using transportation freezers that must reach their destination in maximum 10 days, and the vaccine should be kept at a temperature between -80 and -60 Celsius degrees. Once reaching the destination, the medical unit will transfer the vaccine lots into the storage freezers where the vaccines can be deposited up to 5 days at a temperature between 2-8 degrees Celsius.","Most currently approved strategies for the collection of saliva for COVID-19 diagnostics require specialized tubes containing buffers promoted for the stabilization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virus inactivation. Yet many of these are expensive, in limited supply, and not necessarily validated specifically for viral RNA. While saliva is a promising sample type as it can be reliably self-collected for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, the expense and availability of these collection tubes are prohibitive to mass testing efforts. Therefore, we investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus detection from saliva without supplementation. We tested RNA stability over extended periods of time (2-25 days) and at temperatures representing at-home storage and elevated temperatures which might be experienced when cold chain transport may be unavailable. We found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva from infected individuals is stable at 4\u00b0C, room temperature (~19\u00b0C), and 30\u00b0C for prolonged periods and found limited evidence for viral replication in stored saliva samples. This work demonstrates that expensive saliva collection options involving RNA stabilization and virus inactivation buffers are not always needed, permitting the use of cheaper collection options.

Surgical mask worn by infected patients was shown to limit virus transmission [73,74]. Since asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can be highly contagious, use of masks may be an adjunctive measure to limit virus transmission [75].","We use the synthetic control method to analyze the effect of face masks on the spread of Covid-19 in Germany. Our identification approach exploits regional variation in the point in time when face masks became compulsory. Depending on the region we analyse, we find that face masks reduced the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases between 2.3% and 13% over a period of 10 days after they became compulsory. Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40%.","Therefore, mask wearing has an important role to play in controlling the spread of Covid-19.

Furthermore, a recent modeling study suggests that extensive adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths [55]. Mask use reduces transmission rate in a nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear [55]. As a result, it is anticipated that face coverings made from household fabrics can play a vital role as a mitigating strategy."]},

Thromboprophylaxis should therefore be started in COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital and intermediate therapeutic doses of anticoagulants can be considered in patients requiring ICU admission or those with multiple risk factors for VTE. Extending thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge or in the prehospital phase during home self isolation should be done according to a meticulous risk\/benefit assessment, balancing the reduced risk of VTE with the risk of increased bleeding events. Therapeutic anticoagulation is the cornerstone in the management of patients with PE. Selection of an appropriate agent and correct dosage requires consideration of underlying comorbidities and organ dysfunction. ","Prescription of anticoagulation is quite variable in patients treated for ARDS from Covid-19 admitted to ICU. Different patterns of anticoagulant medication seem not to impact survival. Well-designed prospective studies are urgently required to define this particularly important therapeutic issue affecting millions of patients. ","In view of the reported high incidence of thrombotic events despite prophylactic anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19, [53, 78, 79] there is a strong argument for intensification of anticoagulation in this setting but the benefit of this strategy remains to be determined due to the lack of clinical trial data. While there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend therapeutic anticoagulation in all patients with COVID-19 in the absence of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), an individualised riskbased approach to intensification of anticoagulation may be considered.","Infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can cause prothrombotic complications. We aim to study the frequency of thrombotic complications and impact of anticoagulation on outcomes in hospitalized patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 921 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19. Patients were divided into four groups depending on whether they were on anticoagulation prior to admission, started anticoagulation during the admission, received prophylactic anticoagulation, or did not receive any anticoagulation. At the time of analysis, 325 patients (35.3%) had died, while 544 patients (59%) had been discharged resulting in inpatient mortality of 37.3%. Male sex, age > 65 years, and high D-dimer at admission were associated with higher mortality. Sixteen patients (1.7%) had venous thromboembolism confirmed with imaging, 11 patients had a stroke, and 2 patients developed limb ischemia. Treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with improved inpatient mortality compared with prophylactic anticoagulation alone (63% vs 86.2%, p < 0.0001) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Other outcomes such as rates of liberation from mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation were not significantly impacted by the type of anticoagulation.","The hypercoagulable states that have been observed in COVID-19 patients have been largely pathognomonic for venous thromboembolic events. However hemorrhagic problems may also be an initial manifestation of COVID- 19 [13]. This case report discusses an arterial thromboembolic event in a COVID-19-positive patient requiring surgical intervention. Had the event not been identified in a timely fashion, significant morbidity, and possible amputation of the extremity in question may have been the result. This case report further supports the need for early anticoagulation to prevent the sequelae of CAC and confirms that the virus is a multi-system, multi-organ disease which can predispose those infected to both venous and arterial thromboembolism. Research is still being gathered on the incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients. The debate regarding the intensity of thromboprophylaxis required for patients admitted to the ICU who are at the highest thrombotic risk is still ongoing. While prophylactic anticoagulation has been recommended for patients with COVID-associated coagulopathy [11], it is still unclear whether standard regimens which are used for anticoagulation can be effectively applied for patients infected with the novel coronavirus. Since these patients have significantly elevated D-Dimer levels in the tens of thousands, it may be time to consider higher prophylactic doses of LMWH or UFH to empirically treat COVID-19-positive patients with full anticoagulation. The direct correlation between D-Dimer levels and poor outcomes and thromboembolic events suggests that anticoagulation protocols which correlate to these levels may be needed. Although rapid identification, evaluation, and coordination of care between the providers at the Manhattan VA and Brooklyn VA hospitals saved the upper extremity of this right-handed veteran, he eventually succumbed to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and overwhelming sepsis with a mixed shock picture. However, this case highlights the need to rethink the traditional understanding of prophylactic anticoagulation in these patients."]},

In the case of SARS-CoV, the outbreak was impeded because the symptoms became evident before a patient became infectious. This made the containment of individuals easier. However, increasing lines of evidences have shown that most of the SARS-CoV-2 patients remain asymptomatic carriers. The data repertoire of studies conducted on SARS-CoV is germane to the explorations in the field of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and treatment. The SARS-CoV antigens were reported to be present in organs like liver, pancreas, kidneys and cerebrum as well as bronchi, lungs and intestine (Matsuyama et al., 2005). The severe tissue damage coalescing with SARS, to some extent, has been suggested to be due to the proteases secreted in the target organs of SARS-CoV infected patients (Matsuyama et al., 2005). Apart from the aforementioned proteases, elastase secreted by neutrophils have been proposed to aid in the fusion of SARS-CoV envelope with the host membrane via cell-surface-mediated entrance. This has been subsequently known to enhance virus infection as compared to the canonical endosomal pathway of their entry (Matsuyama et al., 2005).","Yu et al. reported a series of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients among 1524 patients followed an Oncological Hospital in Wuhan.

Infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Although human cortical cells, including astrocytes, have minimal ACE2 expression, we find high levels of alternative coronavirus receptors in infected astrocytes, including DPP4 and CD147.

Based on our data analysis, however, remdesivir with IV administration alone is unlikely to achieve excellent clinical efficacy. This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited. We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.","The binding mode of Remdesivir with the RBD domain of S protein is elaborated in Figure 10. It was observed from the protein and ligand RMSD that there is gradual rise in RMSDs, on visual inspection of the MDS trajectory and analyzing the bond breaking and formation it was found that there are several conformational changes in Remdesivir during the MDS. These conformational changes contribute to the fluctuations in the RMSD. The hydrogen bond between Remdesivir and RBD domain (N12-Arg71) reduces in bond length from 3.26 to 2.90 \u00c5, which explains the drop in RMSD in the last 5 ns (Figures 6 and 8).","Combined, these data illustrate that remdesivir effectively inhibits the proliferation of EV71 post virus entry.","These data indicate that remdesivir acts as an antiviral agent against HCoV-229E, while anti-NRTIs agents were found to be ineffective. This could be due to the unique interaction of remdesivir with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E, while NRTIs inhibit reverse transcriptase. This enzyme has RNA-dependent DNA polymerase function. NRTIs also act as DNA synthesis chain terminators. The mode of interaction of remdesivir with RNA polymerase and the crystal structure of protein-nucleotide have not been published yet. The structure of remdesivir is unique as a nucleotide prodrug, with the presence of a nitrile group at the 1\u2032 position and both 3\u2032 and 4\u2032-hydroxyl groups, leading to strong binding to RNA polymerases that differentiates this compound from the other nucleoside analogs represented here. The structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-COV-2 was recently published [28]. Further structural modification of anti-HIV nucleosides could incorporate some functional groups for binding to RNA polymerases, and be used for more rationale-based antiviral drug design against coronaviruses. Furthermore, the determination of the crystal structure of remdesivir in terms of its binding with RdRp will provide insights into understanding the critical functional groups for the binding and design of the next generation of nucleoside-based inhibitors with higher binding affinities.","Remdesivir, which is the current most suited therapeutic drug for COVID-19 along with a-hederin, Thymohydroquinone and Thymoquinone were further explored more for their mode of action (Figure 4(a-c) ). Since the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 is compromised immunity and it is always associated with inflammation and oxidative stress therefore it is suggested that N. sativa bioactive constituents can be very useful for boosting our immunity and helping patients to overcome the symptoms of COVID-19. While Remdesivir was observed to be targeting proteins involved in growth and proliferation (Figure 4(a) ), a-hederin was observed to be engaged in regulation of blood pressure, regulation of cell communication, regulation of vascular processes, negative regulation of cell death, response to stress and immune effector processes. The genes identified for regulating immune response via a-hederin are ACE2, F2, SRC etc (Figure 4(b) ). Thymohydroquinone was observed to be targeting proteins involved in response to oxidative stress, negative regulation of cell death, regulation of blood pressure, positive regulation of kinase activity, regulation of immune response etc. Regulation of immune response by thymohydroquinone was through genes like HSP90AA1, (Figure 4(c) ) and Thymoquinone was seen to be targeting kinases, heat shock proteins and oxidoreductases (Figure 4(d) )."]},

The high frequency variations that were found to occur maximally in the genomes include L3606F and P4715L (ORF1ab), P323L (RdRp), L37F (NSP6), D614G (S protein), G251V (ORF3a) and L84S (ORF8). Intriguingly, it is observed that few co-mutations such as P323L in RdRp are prevalent and restricted to the countries which are leading in spread and mortality of the infection (including the USA, Spain, Italy, and Germany).","SARS-CoV-2 genomes also harbored three co-occurrent mutations R203K, R203R and G204R in the N protein and were present in all continents except Africa and Asia (besides Taiwan).","We identified a total of 313 synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome across the globe. Several of these mutations were common in majority of the genome samples irrespective of geographical locations, while many other mutations were specific to a specific population. In the present study, we confirmed a link between reduced Interferon and SARS-CoV-2 mutations, and report previously unknown mutations. Two of the reported mutations appear highly linked to the location of the virus and implicate region specific mutations as a response to host environment. With the use of statistical models, such as those described by Cilia et al (27) , and machine learning techniques where input from known mutations is essential, it will become possible to predict hotspots for future mutations and thus prediction of efficacy of any potential vaccines. With the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of any potential vaccines being rendered ineffective against the new strains, it is imperative that the structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein and genome are studied in depth in order, to enable identification of areas of the genome with a higher susceptibility to mutations. ","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious and pathogenic virus has claimed lot of lives globally since its outbreak in December 2019 posing dire threat on public health, global economy, social and human interaction. At moderate rate, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are evolving which might have contributed to viral genome variability, transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world. The present study elucidated the mutational landscape in SARS-CoV-2 genome among the African population, which may have contributed to the virulence, pathogenicity and transmission observed in the region. Multiple sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (356 viral protein sequences) was performed using ClustalX version 2.1 and phylogenetic tree was built using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) X software. ORF1ab polyprotein, spike glycoprotein, ORF3, ORF8 and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were observed as mutational hotspots in the African population and may be of keen interest in the adaptability of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. While, there is conservation in the envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. The accumulation of moderate mutations (though slowly) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as revealed in our study, could be a promising strategy to develop drugs or vaccines with respect to the viral conserved domains and host cellular proteins and\/or receptors involved in viral invasion and replication to avoid a new viral wave due to drug resistance and vaccine evasion.","SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused a world-wide crisis with profound effects on both healthcare and the economy. In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, research groups have shared viral genome sequence data through the GISAID initiative. We collected and computationally profiled ~223,000 full SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences from GISAID over one year for emergent nonsynonymous mutations. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most viral proteins exhibiting little mutational variability. As anticipated, our calculations capture previously reported mutations occurred in the first period of the pandemic, such as D614G (Spike), P323L (NSP12), and R203K\/G204R (Nucleocapsid), but also identify recent mutations like A222V and L18F (Spike) and A220V (Nucleocapsid). Our comprehensive temporal and geographical analyses show two periods with different mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome: Some mutation rates differ also by geography; the main mutations in the second period occurred in Europe. Furthermore, our structure-based molecular analysis provides an exhaustive assessment of mutations in the context of 3D protein structure. Emerging sequence-tostructure data is beginning to reveal the site-specific mutational tolerance of SARS-CoV2 proteins as the virus continues to spread around the globe."]},

This is based on the real risks of influenza during pregnancy that by far outweighs the risks associated with vaccination. During the H1N1 (2009) pandemic, influenza vaccines proved to be safe and effective for pregnant women and their unborn babies; findings very similar to studies of seasonal influenza vaccination in this high risk group.67,68 In line with these recommendations, the advice might be broadened to pregnant women travelling to influenza endemic areas and possibly to persons in close contact with pregnant women or other high-risk individuals, like partners and close family members [CDC guideline: http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/h1n1flu\/clinician_pregnant.htm (26 October 2016, date last accessed)] or travel partners.","Immunizing pregnant women to protect the mother, fetus and infant from infection has increasingly been used over the last decade. Protection against infectious diseases in neonates is mainly provided by maternal antibodies transferred from mother to infant during pregnancy through transplacental transport or after delivery via breastfeeding. Both the transplacental-and breast milk-derived maternal antibodies function as the primary source of protection against infectious diseases in neonates during the first vulnerable weeks of life. During recent infectious disease outbreaks (influenza, pertussis, Zika\u2026) and for other infectious diseases (CMV, GBS\u2026), pregnant women are increasingly identified as an important target for vaccination. For some of these diseases, vaccines are already on the market, and recommended during pregnancy. For others, vaccines are currently under development; furthermore, some are even specifically designed to be administered during pregnancy. Conclusion: This review article provides an overview on the rationale and main mechanism of the maternal vaccination strategy and gives a summary about the current and possible future recommendations for maternal vaccination.","Healthcare professionals explained that pregnant women usually are fearful about receiving vaccines during gestation, but their acceptability depends, according to healthcare professionals, on factors such as perception of risk, educational level and understanding of the benefits, and how information is provided from healthcare professionals to them.","Whilst for many participants this was a hypothetical question, the pregnant women in the group discussions had all been offered the vaccine and seemed anxious about uncritically accepting it. It was typical for these participants to express concern over the safety of the vaccine. For instance, one woman explained: \"I think what worries me is the testing. Has it been tested and how do we know, by taking it, that it's not going to affect our baby so I won't take it\" (Emily, FG 6). Three other participants also stated they were not planning to have the vaccine and mentioned the case of Thalidomide as highlighting the dangers of insufficiently tested drugs taken during pregnancy. However, one participant was scathing of links between the swine flu vaccination and Thalidomide, stating:","Both in Colombia and Spain, women explained they would want to be vaccinated as soon as possible, before pregnancy, or in the first months of gestation, arguing that it would offer more protection against the negative effects of ZIKV on their fetuses. However, they also reinforced the idea of being vaccinated when their healthcare assistants recommend them to do so (first, second or third trimester of pregnancy)."]},

As such, understanding its ongoing repercussions, including the characteristics of recovery from COVID-19, require longitudinal studies that will shed light on the varied impacts on individuals, populations, and societies. This study contributes to this process by highlighting several predictors of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. It indicates clearly that both demographic and psychological variables support management of the pandemic. The data present that women and individuals with economic difficulties tend to present higher levels of distress and sense of danger. However, a more inclusive model of predictions reveals that in each of the two measurements, psychological factors have impacted coping with COVID-19 to a greater extent than demographic variables. Perceived well-being was found to be the best predictor of decreased distress symptoms and sense of danger, followed by individual resilience level. Further studies that track the societal and individual impacts of the pandemic over time are recommended.","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced our society to come face to face with complex issues that were once theoretical but are now being played out in real time. As data from the pandemic accumulates, it is clear that COVID-19 is impacting some parts of society more than others. Unfortunately, there is an almost complete overlap between COVID-19 risk factors and conditions that are already represented as health disparities, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease and immune disorders. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological pathways that link these diseases to COVID-19 outcome. An increased awareness of the factors underlying this issue, both societal and medical, is needed to understand the long-term implications and possible solutions needed going forward.","Finally, as we write the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping across the globe with unprecedented socio-economical costs.

The increased anxiety caused by the pandemic heightened the likelihood of cyber-attacks succeeding corresponding with an increase in the number and range of cyber-attacks. This paper analyses the COVID-19 pandemic from a cyber-crime perspective and highlights the range of cyberattacks experienced globally during the pandemic. Cyberattacks are analysed and considered within the context of key global events to reveal the modus-operandi of cyberattack campaigns. The analysis shows how following what appeared to be large gaps between the initial outbreak of the pandemic in China and the first COVID-19 related cyber-attack, attacks steadily became much more prevalent to the point that on some days, 3 or 4 unique cyber-attacks were being reported. The analysis proceeds to utilise the UK as a case study to demonstrate how cyber-criminals leveraged key events and governmental announcements to carefully craft and design cyber-crime campaigns.","Finally, as we write the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping across the globe with unprecedented socio-economical costs.

In this commentary, we discuss how this enormous challenge could be addressed for viral vector-based Covid-19 vaccines by learning from the wealth of formulation development experience gained over the years on stability issues related to live attenuated virus vaccines and viral vector vaccines for other diseases. This experience has led -over time-to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8\u00b0C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 \u00b0C be considered. In confronting this \"perfect storm\" of Covid-19 vaccine stability challenges, understanding the many lessons learned from decades of development and manufacturing of live virus-based vaccines is the shortest path for finding promising and rapid solutions.

We have considered that the distribution company delivers the vaccine lots to the interested medical care unit, using transportation freezers that must reach their destination in maximum 10 days, and the vaccine should be kept at a temperature between -80 and -60 Celsius degrees. Once reaching the destination, the medical unit will transfer the vaccine lots into the storage freezers where the vaccines can be deposited up to 5 days at a temperature between 2-8 degrees Celsius.","There are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19. Anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody-containing plasmas, obtained from the recovered individuals who had confirmed COVID-19, have been started to be collected using apheresis devices and stored in blood banks in some countries in order to administer to the patients with COVID-19 for reducing the need of intensive care and the mortality rates. Therefore, in this review, we aim to point out some important issues related to convalescent plasma (CP) and its use in COVID-19. CP may be an adjunctive treatment option to the anti-viral therapy.","Finally, as cold chain transportation is not available in many COVID-19 epidemic areas, a vaccine that can be stored at room temperature will be highly desirable. The thermal stability of the ARCoV mRNA-LNP vaccine was evaluated using the FLuc reporter mRNA-LNP formulation. After storage for 1, 4 and 7 days at different temperatures, the FLuc reporter mRNA-LNP was intramuscularly administered into BALB\/c mice and mice were subjected to in vivo BLI imaging 6 h later. As shown in Figure S8A , there was no reduction in FLuc expression between all groups, indicating that our mRNA-LNP formulation is stable at 4\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C for at least 7 days. Storage at 37\u00b0C for 7 days only resulted in a ~13% reduction in relative photon flux ( Figure S8B ). These results indicated the high thermostability of ARCoV vaccine.","Effective therapies are urgently needed for COVID-19. Here we describe the identification of a new stable human immunoglobulin G1 heavy-chain variable (VH) domain scaffold that was used for the construction of a large library, lCAT6, of engineered human VHs. This library was panned against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. Two VH domains (VH ab6 and VH m397) were selected and fused to Fc for increased half-life in circulation. The VH-Fc ab6 and m397 specifically neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with high potencies (50% neutralization at 0.35 \u00b5g\/ml and 1.5 \u00b5g\/ml, respectively) as measured by two independent replication-competent virus neutralization assays. Ab6 and m397 competed with ACE2 for binding to RBD, suggesting a competitive mechanism of virus neutralization. These VH domains may have potential applications for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19 alone or in combination, as well as for diagnosis and as tools for research. ARTICLE HISTORY"]},

Specifically, the suggestion has been made that ACE inhibitors or ARBs could theoretically contribute to infection via increasing ACE2 receptor expression and hence increase viral load. The ACE2 receptor is responsible for binding the SAR-CoV2 viral spike and causing COVID-19 infection. What makes the argument somewhat obtuse for ACE inhibitors or ARBs is that ACE2 receptor expression can be increased by compounds that activate or increase the expression of SIRT1. Henceforth common dietary interventions, vitamins and nutrients may directly or indirectly influence the cellular expression of the ACE2 receptor. There are many common compounds that can increase the expression of the ACE2 receptor including Vitamin C, Metformin, Resveratrol, Vitamin B3 and Vitamin D. It is important to acknowledge that down-regulation or blocking the cellular ACE2 receptor will likely be pro-inflammatory and may contribute to end organ pathology and mortality in COVID-19. In conclusion from the perspective of the ACE2 receptor, COVID-19 prevention and treatment are distinctly different. This letter reflects on this current debate and suggests angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs are likely beneficial during COVID-19 infection for hypertensive and normotensive patients.","The possible effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on COVID-19 disease severity have generated considerable debate. We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, who had definite clinical outcome (dead or discharged) by February 15, 2020. Patients on anti-hypertensive treatment with or without ACEI\/ARB were compared on their clinical characteristics and outcomes. The medical records from 702 patients were screened. Among the 101 patients with a history of hypertension and taking at least one anti-hypertensive medication, 40 patients were receiving ACEI\/ARB as part of their regimen, and 61 patients were on antihypertensive medication other than ACEI\/ARB. We observed no statistically significant differences in percentages of in-hospital mortality (28% vs. 34%, P = 0.46), ICU admission (20% vs. 28%, P = 0.37) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18% vs. 26%, P = 0.31) between patients with or without ACEI\/ARB treatment. Further multivariable adjustment of age and gender did not provide evidence for a significant association between ACEI\/ARB treatment and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Our findings confirm the lack of an association between chronic receipt of reninangiotensin system antagonists and severe outcomes of COVID-19. Patients should continue previous antihypertensive therapy until further evidence is available.","There have been arguments on whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) treatment alters the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. We identified a total of 102 eligible studies for systematic review, in which 49 studies adjusting for confounders were included in the meta-analysis. We found no association between prior ACEI\/ARB use and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in general population (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.05). The risk of mortality (aOR 0.87, 95%CI 0.66-1.04) and severe outcomes (aOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.73-1.24) are also unchanged among COVID-19 patients taking ACEI\/ARB. These findings remain consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by populations, drug exposures and in other secondary outcomes. This systematic review provides evidence-based support to current medical guidelines and position statements that ACEI\/ARB should not be discontinued. Additionally, there has been no evidence for initiating ACEI\/ARB regimen as prevention or treatment of COVID-19.","While our understanding of the virus deepens and with the constant improvement of diagnosis and treatment and strategies for prevention and control, pharmacists should continue to actively collect and improve their services based on the latest information.

Key words: Corticosteroids, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, propensity index.","Purpose: To determine clinical predictors associated with corticosteroid administration and its association with ICU mortality in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia. Methods: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza pneumonia admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain between June 2009 and April 2014. Patients who received corticosteroid treatment for causes other than viral pneumonia (e.g., refractory septic shock and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) were excluded. Patients with corticosteroid therapy were compared with those without corticosteroid therapy. We use a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to reduce confounding factors. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analysis was performed to assess the impact of corticosteroids on ICU mortality. A total of 1846 patients with primary influenza pneumonia were enrolled. Corticosteroids were administered in 604 (32.7%) patients, with methylprednisolone the most frequently used corticosteroid (578\/604 [95.7%]). The median daily dose was equivalent to 80 mg of methylprednisolone (IQR 60-120) for a median duration of 7 days (IQR 5-10). Asthma, COPD, hematological disease, and the need for mechanical ventilation were independently associated with corticosteroid use. Crude ICU mortality was higher in patients who received corticosteroids (27.5%) than in patients who did not receive corticosteroids (18.8%, p < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid use was associated with ICU mortality in the Cox (HR = 1.32 [95% CI 1.08-1.60], p < 0.006) and competing risks analysis (SHR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.12-1.68], p = 0.001).

The primary outcome was 60-day in-hospital death. The exposure was prescribed systemic corticosteroids or not. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 60-day in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 382 patients [60.7 \u00b1 14.1 years old (mean \u00b1 SD), 61.3% males] were analyzed. The median of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0-3.0). Of these cases, 94 (24.6%) patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. The number of patients received systemic corticosteroids was 226 (59.2%), and 156 (40.8%) received standard treatment. The maximum dose of corticosteroids was 80.0 (IQR 40.0-80.0) mg equivalent methylprednisolone per day, and duration of corticosteroid treatment was 7.0 (4.0-12.0) days in total. In Cox regression analysis using corticosteroid treatment as a time-varying variable, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death within 60 days after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA score at hospital admission, propensity score of corticosteroid treatment, comorbidities, antiviral treatment, and respiratory supports (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21, 0.85; p = 0.0160). Corticosteroids were not associated with delayed viral RNA clearance in our cohort. In this clinical practice setting, low-dose corticosteroid treatment was associated with reduced risk of in-hospital death within 60 days in COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS.","In conclusion, corticosteroids use in viral pneumonia remains a challenging clinical puzzle. Although corticosteroid therapy was reported to improve the clinical features of viral pneumonia in some case, there is no confirmed evidence of corticosteroid therapy reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients. The clinical use of corticosteroid for COVID-19 patients should be cautious if at all. Cytokine storm and the suppression and deficiency of T cell immune may be the main potential mechanism of severe COVID-19. Randomized controlled clinical trials of early administration low-to-moderate dose of methylprednisolone for COVID-19 patients with ARDS are desperately in need to confirm the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids therapy and further study the long-term outcomes after discharge.","There is still controversy about the role of corticosteroids for management of COVID-19 pneumonia. In MERS-CoV, corticosteroids was associated with prolonged viral clearance time. However, recent evidence suggested a decrease in mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome when using corticosteroids [30] . As corticosteroids suppress the overwhelming inflammation mediated by the hyperimmune response and decrease alveolar exudation [31] , the use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids (0.5-1 mg\/kg\/d for less than 7 days) in select patients has been recommended by the Chinese Thoracic Society [32] . Colchicine may also alleviate this cytokine storm through a distinct pathway. Gandolfini et al. [33] reported that the administration of colchicine may reduce the exaggerated inflammatory response in transplant recipients with COVID-19. It should be noted that whatever medical treatments are used, it is important to find a delicate balance that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the potential harm."]},

However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176-206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease. Finally, these predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this high priority virus.","Motivated by the promising results of SOSIP-NVP, we sought to apply the NVP technology for COVID-19 vaccine development. According to previous studies, the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the interaction with ACE2 receptors on the human cells which leads to viral infection. Inducing antibody response against S protein therefore is an effective strategy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [26,27]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the functional region within the S protein that engages ACE2, and has been suggested as a great target for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 [28,29]. In addition, our analysis on genetic sequence comparison between SARS-CoV-2 variants reported on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as of August 2020 and the original SARS-CoV-2 that appeared in Wuhan in 2019 indicated high conservation of RBD genetic sequence, compared with other genetic regions (Fig. 6a-b), thus highlighting RBD as a promising target for COVID-19 vaccine development.","An important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for SARS-cOV-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms, including nucleic acids (dNA and RNA), virus-like particles, peptides, viral vector (replicative and non-replicative), recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses. Many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized, but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speeds.","An important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for SARS-COV-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms, including nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), virus-like particles, peptides, viral vector (replicative and non-replicative), recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses. Many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized, but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speeds.","Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S proteinbased vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus nonneutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-\u03b3. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04436276). npj Vaccines (2020) 5:91 ; https:\/\/doi."]},

Recently, BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib have been found to protect against pulmonary injury in a small group of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines found in the circulation of COVID-19 patients with severe lung disease suggest the involvement of the innate immune system in this process. Understanding the potential mechanism of action of BTK inhibition in SARS-CoV-2 is clearly of importance to determine how acalabrutinib, ibrutinib and possibly other BTK inhibitors may provide protection against lung injury.","Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling is involved in innate immune responses and regulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines that can contribute to COVID-19 immunopathology. Clinical trials with BTK inhibitors in COVID-19 treatment have been proposed, and previous studies have attempted to investigate the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib and underlying mechanisms in treating viral pneumonia. These attempts, however, did not consider potential off target effect of BTK inhibitors on T cell differentiation, function, and survival, which may be beneficial in treatment for COVID-19. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of BTK\/IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) signaling in immunopathology and lymphopenia and discuss the potential of BTK\/ITK dual inhibitors such as ibrutinib in modulating immunopathology and lymphopenia, for COVID-19 therapy.","COVID-19 is a medical emergency, with 20% of patients presenting with severe clinical manifestations. From the pathogenetic point of view, COVID-19 mimics two other well-known diseases characterized by cytokine storm and hyperactivation of the immune response, with consequent organ damage: acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Hematologists are confident with these situations requiring a prompt therapeutic approach for switching off the uncontrolled cytokine release; here, we discuss pros and cons of drugs that are already J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f employed in hematology in the light of their possible application in COVID-19. The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1\/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab. We also present immunological data from gene expression experiments where TKIs resulted effective anti-inflammatory and pro-immune drugs. A possible combined treatment algorithm for COVID-19 is here proposed.","The pandemic threat of COVID-19 with more than 37 million cases in which about 5 percent entering critical stage characterized by cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory condition, the state more often leads to admission to intensive care unit with rapid mortality. Janus kinase enzymes of Jak-1, Jak-2, Jak-3, and Tyk2 seem to be good targets for inhibition by medications to control cytokine storm in this context. In the present work, the inhibitory properties of different analgesic drugs on these targets are studied to assess their ability for clinical application from different points of view. Our docking results indicated that naproxen, methadone, and amitriptyline considering their higher binding energy, lower energy variance and higher hydrophobicity, seem to express more inhibitory effects on Janus kinase enzymes than thats for approved inhibitors i.e. baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Accordingly, we suggest our wide list of candidate drugs including indomethacin, etodolac, buprenorphine, rofecoxib, duloxetine, valdecoxib, naproxen, methadone, and amitriptilin for clinical assessments for their usefulness in COVID-19 treatment, especially taking into account that up to now, there is no approved cure for this disease.","With anti-neoplastic agents, many cardiotoxicities are well known, Figure 6. Development of these cardiotoxicities should be closely monitored and may be detrimental to patients with COVID-19. BTK inhibitors are associated with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and bleeding due to abnormal platelet aggregation [128,129]. Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, is associated with a 4-fold increase in atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias [130,131]. This increased arrhythmia risk is of concern with COVID-19 due to high occurrence rate of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in up to 15% of hospitalized patients. In addition, 78% of patients on ibrutinib developed new or worsening hypertension over a median of 30 months, which is associated with major adverse cardiac events [128]. Up to half of patients on ibrutinib for three years will have a major bleeding event, likely through inhibition of key platelet signaling molecules [132,133]."]},

Currently, vaccine development is too slow for vaccines to be used in the control of emerging pandemics. RNA-based vaccines might be suitable to meet this challenge. The use of an RNA-based delivery mechanism promises fast vaccine development, clinical approval, and production. The simplicity of in vitro transcription of mRNA suggests potential for fast, scalable, and low-cost manufacture. RNA vaccines are safe in theory and have shown acceptable tolerability in first clinical trials. Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in phase 1 trials looks promising, however induction of cellular immunity needs to be confirmed and optimized. Further optimization of RNA vaccine modification and formulation to this end is needed, which may also enable single injection regimens to be achievable. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines, which show high immunogenicity at low doses, might help to improve potency while keeping manufacturing costs low and speed high. With theoretical properties of RNA vaccines looking promising, their clinical efficacy is the key remaining question with regard to their suitability for tackling emerging pandemics. This question might be answered by ongoing efficacy trials of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.","Background While major progress has been made to establish diagnostic tools for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, determining the severity of COVID-19 remains an unmet medical need. There is a limited availability of hospital resources in this or any pandemic, and appropriately gauging severity would allow for some patients to safely recover in home quarantine, while ensuring that sicker patients get needed care. We here developed a blood-based generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for the severity of viral infections and validated it in multiple viral infection settings including COVID-19. We used training data (N=705) from 21 retrospective transcriptomic clinical studies of influenza and other viral illnesses looking at a preselected panel of host immune mRNAs. We selected 6 host mRNAs and trained a logistic regression classifier with a training cross-validation AUROC of 0.90 for predicting 30-day mortality in viral illnesses. Next, in 1,417 samples across 21 independent retrospective validation cohorts the locked 6-mRNA classifier had an AUROC of 0.91 for discriminating patients with severe vs. non-severe infection. Next, in an independent cohort of prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed COVID-19 (N=97) in Athens, Greece, the 6-mRNA locked classifier had an AUROC of 0.89 for identifying patients with severe respiratory failure or 30-day mortality. Finally, we developed an isothermal qRT-LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal gene expression) assay for the 6-mRNA panel to facilitate implementation as a rapid assay. With further study, the classifier could assist in the risk assessment of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 to determine severity and level of care, thereby improving patient management and healthcare burden.","A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to 47 immunise large populations. We report the preclinical development of two BNT162b vaccine 48 candidates, which contain lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA 49 encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-derived immunogens. BNT162b1 encodes a 50 soluble, secreted, trimerised receptor-binding domain (RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the 51 full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation (P2 S). The 52 flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% 53 of the P 2S trimers are in the two-RBD 'down,' one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular 54 dose of either candidate elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry 55 inhibition titres and strong TH1 CD4 + and IFN\uf067 + CD8 + T-cell responses. Prime\/boost 56 vaccination of rhesus macaques with BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2 neutralising 57 geometric mean titres 8.2 to 18.2 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum 58 panel. The vaccine candidates protect macaques from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with BNT162b2 59 protecting the lower respiratory tract from the presence of viral RNA and with no evidence of 60 disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase 1 trials in Germany and the 61 United States. BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global, pivotal Phase 2\/3 trial 62 (NCT04380701, NCT04368728). 63 Due to the shattering impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on human 66 health and society, multiple collaborative research programs have been launched, generating 67 new insights and progress in vaccine development. Soon after emerging in December 2019, the 68 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as a \u03b2-69 coronavirus with high sequence similarity to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses 1,2 . Fast 70 pandemic vaccine availability is critical, and the rapid globalised response is mirrored by the 71 upload of over 212,000 viral genome sequences as of November 23, 2020, to GISAID (Global 72 Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data). 73 The trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for virus neutralising 74 antibodies 3 and the prime candidate for vaccine development. S binds its cellular receptor, 75 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through a receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is 76 part of S1, its N-terminal furin cleavage fragment 4,5 . On S, the RBDs have 'up' positions, in 77 which the receptor binding sites and their dense cluster of neutralising epitopes are exposed, 78 and 'down' positions, in which the receptor binding sites are buried, but some S neutralising 79 epitopes on and off the RBDs remain available 6-9 . S rearranges to translocate the virus into cells 80 by membrane fusion 6,10 . The C-terminal furin cleavage fragment, S2, contains the fusion 81 machinery 11 . 82 Messenger RNA technology allows versatile vaccine antigen design and highly scalable, fast 83 manufacturing. With efficient lipid-nanoparticle (LNP) formulation processes, RNA vaccines 84 are highly suited to rapid development and pandemic supply 12,13 . RNA generated from DNA 85 templates by a highly productive, cell-free in vitro transcription process is molecularly well 86 defined and free of animal-origin materials. Here, we report the preclinical development of the 87 LNP formulated N 1 -methyl-pseudouridine (m1\u03a8) nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA) 88 BNT162b vaccine candidates that encode SARS-CoV-2 S-derived immunogens (Fig. 1a) . The 89 m1\u03a8-modification dampens innate immune sensing and, together with optimised non-coding 90 sequence elements, increases efficiency of RNA translation in vivo [13][14][15] . Vaccines based on 91 modRNA have proven immunogenic for several viral targets 16,17 . 92 Results BNT162b1 RNA encodes the RBD with the SARS-CoV-2 S signal peptide (SP) fused to its N-97 terminus to enable ER translocation and secretion and with the trimerisation domain (foldon) 98 of T4 fibritin 21 fused to its C-terminus for multimeric display; BNT162b2 RNA encodes full-99 length S, stabilised in the prefusion conformation by the mutation of residues 986 and 987 to 100 proline (P2 S; Fig. 1a ) 7,22,23 . Both RNAs have single, sharp microfluidic capillary 101 electrophoresis profiles, consistent with their calculated lengths, indicating high purity and 102 integrity (Fig. 1b). Robust expression of RBD-foldon or P2 S was detectable by flow cytometry 103 upon transfection of HEK293T cells with BNT162b1 RNA or BNT162b2 RNA, respectively, 104 formulated as LNPs or mixed with a transfection reagent (Extended Data Fig. 1a). In transfected 105 cells, BNT162b1-encoded RBD and BNT162b2-encoded P2 S localised to the secretory 106 pathway as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 1b). A main band 107 of RBD-containing protein with an apparent MW >75 kDa was detected in the medium of 108 BNT162b1 RNA-transfected cells (together with lesser quantities of a faster migrating species) 109 by western blot under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions, consistent with secretion of 110 trimeric RBD-foldon (predicted MW 88.4 kD; Extended Data Fig. 1c). 111 For further structural characterisation, the RBD-foldon and P2 S antigens were expressed from 112 DNA corresponding to the RNA coding sequences. The RBD-foldon was purified from the 113 medium of transfected Expi293F cells by affinity capture with the ACE2-peptidase domain 114 (PD) immobilised on agarose beads, leaving little residual RBD-foldon uncaptured from the 115 medium. Evidence that the RBD-foldon has three RBDs flexibly tethered to a central hub was 116 obtained by electron microscopy (EM), which revealed a variety of conformations (Fig. 1c) . 117 The trimerised RBD bound to the human ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) with a KD of <5 pM, 118 which is 1,000-fold the reported KD of 5 nM for monomeric RBD and consistent with the avidity 119 effect of multivalent binding enabled by the flexible tethering (Extended Data Fig. 1d) . 120 Although the flexibility of the RBD-foldon precluded direct structural analysis at high 121 resolution, one RBD per trimer could be immobilised by binding to a complex of ACE2 and 122 the B 0 AT1 neutral amino acid transporter, which ACE2 chaperones, when that complex was in 123 the previously reported closed conformation (Fig. 1d ) 5 .

In addition to the adjuvants described above, engineered nanomaterials also shed light adjuvant development. It has been shown that physicochemical characteristics of aluminum oxyhydroxide could affect the optimal immunogenicity profiles of vaccine formulations (41, 83, 84). Moreover, a recent study has shown that an alum-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE) showed robust RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG2a titers and a high level of inducing IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells in a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, it has been shown that a natural and potent STING agonist encapsulated by pulmonary biomimetic liposomes triggered rapid humoral and cellular immune responses and exhibited a sustained cross-protection against influenza (76). However, more comprehensive mechanistic studies, including the nature of protective immune responses and screening of the various combinations of antigens and adjuvants, are needed for the successful development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine."]},

Overall, we identified delirium in 234 participants (33%). On admission, 86 (12%) were delirious. We observed 263 deaths (37%) in our sample, and in-hospital mortality reached 55% in patients who experienced delirium. Delirium was associated with in-hospital death, with an adjusted odds ratio [aOR] of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]= 1.15-2.66); the association held both in middle-aged and older adults. Delirium was also associated with increased length of stay, admission to intensive care, and ventilator utilization.","Delirium is frequently found in patients who test positive for COVID-19, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. There appears to be a higher rate of agitation, myoclonus, abulia, and alogia. No data are currently available on the treatment of delirium in COVID-19 patients. Extrapolating from general delirium treatment, MERS\/SARS case reports, and our experience, preliminary recommendations for pharmacologic management have been assembled.","COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation. A severe course of COVID-19 illness is expected in particular in elderly patients with multimorbidity. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses, especially \u03b2-coronaviruses to which the SARS-CoV-2 belongs, do not limit their presence to the respiratory tract and frequently invade the CNS and data indicate that severe systemic comorbidities including acute neurologic illness are associated with the novel viral infection and lead to significant outcome differences [31, 32]. Some patients with COVID-19 may show non-specific neurological symptoms, such as delirium, that may precede symptoms of fever and cough. Older adults experiencing delirium are vulnerable. Compared with non-delirious patients, delirious patients are more likely to consume more hospital staff time and precious life-support resources, stay longer, and develop in-hospital complications. While created to minimize contagion, policies that increase isolation and immobility for hospitalized patients, combined with acute illness, produce a high-risk environment for delirium [24]. COVID-19 precautions can make the management of delirium challenging. Considering advance care planning with older adults during COVID-19 is extremely important for patients, family members, and clinicians."]},

Surgical mask worn by infected patients was shown to limit virus transmission [73,74]. Since asymptomatic COVID-19 patients can be highly contagious, use of masks may be an adjunctive measure to limit virus transmission [75].","We use the synthetic control method to analyze the effect of face masks on the spread of Covid-19 in Germany. Our identification approach exploits regional variation in the point in time when face masks became compulsory. Depending on the region we analyse, we find that face masks reduced the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases between 2.3% and 13% over a period of 10 days after they became compulsory. Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40%.","Therefore, mask wearing has an important role to play in controlling the spread of Covid-19. Given the effectiveness of mask wearing in significantly curbing the transmission of the airborne Covid-19 virus and, thus, reducing the number of infections and fatalities, it would be helpful for governments to focus more 11 .

Furthermore, a recent modeling study suggests that extensive adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths [55]. Mask use reduces transmission rate in a nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear [55]. As a result, it is anticipated that face coverings made from household fabrics can play a vital role as a mitigating strategy."]},

Several promising drug targets have been identified, and several organizations are working relentlessly to develop vaccines against these targets ( Table 1 ). Different available antiviral drugs (repurposed) are being tested for COVID-19 in large clinical trials, as they have shown some positive effects in initial phases ( Table 2 ;  Figure 1 ). Contradictory reports are also started to pouring in against some antiviral therapies targeted at COVID-19, where although initial reports suggested positive effects, later others showed no effect. For example, hydroxychloroquine treatment, along with azithromycin, has shown a significant reduction of viral load in COVID-19 infected patients (Gautret et al., 2020), but subsequent report refutes that claim and showed no benefit in severe COVID-19 patients by this treatment (Molina et al., 2020). Repurposing existing antiviral drugs against COVID-19 has shown some positive effects, but further scientific results are necessary to prove whether these affect COVID-19 treatment, or we are just looking at the placebo effect which can be dangerous for patients.","The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread throughout the globe by preferentially affecting older individuals with underlying CV comorbidities.

To fill in this gap, we characterized COVID-19 patients at the time at which they were diagnosed in outpatient settings and estimated 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates. Methods: This was a population-based cohort study.Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP)-a primary-care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and hospital emergency, inpatient and mortality registers. We included all patients in the database who were 15 years old and diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings between 15 March and 24 April 2020 (10 April for outcome studies). Baseline characteristics included socio-demographics, co-morbidity and previous drug use at the time of diagnosis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and results.Study outcomes included 30-day hospitalization for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality. Results: We identified 118 150 and 95 467 COVID-19 patients for characterization and outcome studies, respectively. Most were women (58.7%) and young-to-middle-aged (e.g. Original Article 21.1% were 45-54 years old). Of the 44 575 who were tested with PCR, 32 723 (73.4%) tested positive. In the month after diagnosis, 14.8% (14.6-15.0) were hospitalized, with a greater proportion of men and older people, peaking at age 75-84 years. Thirty-day fatality was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.4% to 3.6%), higher in men, increasing with age and highest in those residing in nursing homes [24.5% (23.4% to 25.6%)]. Conclusion: COVID-19 infections were widespread in the community, including all agesex strata. However, severe forms of the disease clustered in older men and nursinghome residents. Although initially managed in outpatient settings, 15% of cases required hospitalization and 4% died within a month of first symptoms. These data are instrumental for designing deconfinement strategies and will inform healthcare planning and hospital-bed allocation in current and future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Background The recent emergence of COVID-19 poses a global health emergency. One of the most frequently reported data is sex-related severity and mortality: according to the last available analysis on 239,709 patients in Italy, lethality is 17.7% in men and 10.8% in women, with 59% of total deaths being men. Interestingly, the infection rate is lower in males than in females, with 45.8% and 54.2% of positive cases, respectively, suggesting that gender-related factor may worsen disease evolution. A tentative hypothesis to explain these findings is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2 involved in viral infection. Purpose In this review, we summarize the available evidence pointing to gender-related differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, from both genetic and endocrine points of view. Results Altogether, available evidence points toward two not-mutually exclusive mechanisms in gender susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex hormonal regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. On one hand, ACE2 expression could be increased in women, either by estrogens or constitutively by X chromosome inactivation escape or by reduced methylation, providing a larger reservoir of ACE2 to maintain the fundamental equilibrium of RAS regulatory axis. On the other, low levels of androgens in women may keep at low levels TMPRSS2 expression, representing a further protective factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, despite the increased expression of ACE2, which represents the Trojan horse for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Conclusions Both mechanisms consistently point to the role of sex hormones and sex chromosomes in the differential severity and lethality of COVID-19 in men and women.","This is the first study to date on the characteristics, hospital admissions and fatality associated with COVID-19 disease diagnosed in outpatient settings. COVID-19 is often diagnosed and initially managed in outpatient clinics, with limited testing leading to underreported cases in official figures and overestimated fatality. Notwithstanding this, COVID-19 in our wide sample led to hospitalization in 15% of diagnosed patients and a 30-day fatality of 4%. Our data suggest that, although COVID-19 infection has spread throughout the Catalonia, Spain community, most often in young and middle-aged women, severe forms of the disease and all-cause fatality cluster in older men and among nursing-home residents. This information is of key relevance for healthcare professionals, public-health authorities and commissioners, now and in future COVID-19 outbreaks."]},

However, low-dose dexamethasone (6 mg once daily, orally or intravenously, for 10 days) has been shown to be effective in reducing deaths by one-third in patients on mechanical ventilation and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen only.

Some in-vitro studies found the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ), and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are effective against COVID19. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials in humans have produced conflicting findings on the efficacy and safety of these drugs. Guidelines vary considerably and are hotly debated at political and scientific levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to provide a summary of the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in treating COVID19 infection, using an overview of the existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses.","In closing, we remind that safety of the patient suffering from COVID19 is a key priority to improve the quality of care in the provision of health services. Currently, no therapeutic option has been shown to be effective (though remdesivir is presently revealing promise as one option likely in conjunction with another treatment (s)) and that conclusively allows for safe and effective use to mitigate or eliminate the causative agent of COVID-19; The very same can be said about prophylaxis whereby approximately 200 therapeutic options or their combinations are being investigated in more than 1,700 clinical trials. Severely ill patients with COVID-19, frequently older adults and with established comorbidities, are being given multiple concomitant medications and without considering possible adverse events and interactions. This is an area of research that is being overlooked and the potential toxicity due to concomitant treatments must be urgently addressed. We again remind that the use of medications such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (alone or in combination with azithromycin), ivermectin, antivirals, and immunomodulators, among others, should be considered within the context of patient consented, randomized clinical trials that evaluate their safety and efficacy. Ensuring the safety of patients with COVID-19 requires information and surveillance systems that include standardized procedures in order to report adverse events and interactions according to local settings and public health reporting regulations. If these do not exist, they must be implemented immediately.","Purpose: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed."]},

However, the immediate source species of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. Here, we used diversity analysis of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has been proved to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for spike protein priming. We also simulated the structure of receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 S RBD) with the ACE2s to investigate their binding affinity to determine the potential intermediate animal hosts that could spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus to humans in South Asia. We identified cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, which are predominant species in the household farming system in South Asia that can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2. All the bird species studied along with rat and mouse were considered less potential to interact with SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and ACE2 protein complex suggests pangolin as a potential intermediate host in SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide a valuable resource for the identification of potential hosts for SARS-CoV-2 in South Asia and henceforth reduce the opportunity for a future outbreak of COVID-19.","Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that binding to ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we propose a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated for the modeled Spike-RBD\/ACE2 complex structures correlated closely with the effectiveness of animal infection as determined by multiple experimental data sets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggest a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggests a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation, but also, more importantly, it proposes a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 23 2019, and became pandemic.

Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for 27 SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. 28 Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological 29 changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a 30 potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize 31 the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir.

The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We additionally provide an interactive userfriendly web-application to query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Journal Pre-proof 2 to its novel human host.

These, together with a mutation in the Spike protein (21575, Codon 5), comprise the strongest putative regions under selection in our dataset. The current distribution of genomic diversity as well as ongoing allele frequency changes both between isolates and along the SARS-CoV-2 genome are publicly available as an open access and interactive web-resource available here: https:\/\/macman123.shinyapps.io\/ugi-scov2-alignment-screen\/.","Our main work is to identify the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The host identification is of essential importance to the control of virus spread and to prevent another round of emergence outbreak. The correct identification of host, source or intermediate, could lead to the effective policy to isolate humans and hosts, therefore eliminating the risk of human exposure to new viruses and limiting further transmission. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, many patients were found to have had animal exposure, especially during the early stage of the outbreak.

Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a drug repurposing pipeline that systematically integrates multiple SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural networks, and in-vitro\/population-based validations. We first collected all the available drugs (n= 3,635) involved in COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a SARS-CoV-2 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate drug's representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and electronic health records. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19.

Using our state-of-the-art network proximity framework, we measured the \u201cclosest\u201d proximities of nearly 3,000 drugs and the four SARS-CoV-2 host gene\/protein profiles (SARS2-DEG, SARS2-DEP, HCoV-PPI, and SARS2-PPI). Additionally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using five gene\/protein expression data sets, including one SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomics, one SARS-CoV-2 proteomics, one MERS-CoV and two SARS-CoV-1 transcriptomics data sets (see Methods). GSEA was used to evaluate the individual drugs for their potential to reverse the expression at the transcriptome or proteome level altered by the viruses.","In summary, our results reveal potential candidates for drug repositioning to SARS-CoV-2 therapy. The candidates we found include drugs from categories other than \"antivirals for systemic use\" (based on ATC code), suggesting that drugs with various indications should be considered in future studies. Given the scarcity of omics-level data from SARS-CoV-2 infected lung tissue, our surrogate transcriptomic-driven drug discovery approach has prioritized the list of potential candidate drugs to be experimentally examined in preclinical studies, to be considered for empirical clinical use when it is needed, and to open novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of COVID-19.","Therefore, we next performed network-based drug repurposing modeling using the existing knowledge of the drug\u2013target network and the global map of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome built in this study.

Recent technological advancements have alleviated some issues that hinder mRNA vaccine development, such as low efficiency that exist in both gene translation and in vivo deliveries. mRNA immunogenicity can also be greatly adjusted as a result of upgraded technologies. In this review, we have summarized details regarding the optimization of mRNA vaccines, and the underlying biological mechanisms of this form of vaccines. Applications of mRNA vaccines in some infectious diseases and cancers are introduced. It also includes our prospections for mRNA vaccine applications in diseases caused by bacterial pathogens, such as tuberculosis.

Currently, vaccine development is too slow for vaccines to be used in the control of emerging pandemics. RNA-based vaccines might be suitable to meet this challenge.

The simplicity of in vitro transcription of mRNA suggests potential for fast, scalable, and low-cost manufacture. RNA vaccines are safe in theory and have shown acceptable tolerability in first clinical trials.

Further optimization of RNA vaccine modification and formulation to this end is needed, which may also enable single injection regimens to be achievable. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines, which show high immunogenicity at low doses, might help to improve potency while keeping manufacturing costs low and speed high.

The finding of a safe and attractive target for vaccine development is of utmost importance at this point to prevent further spread of this virus. Unfortunately, the way SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world and infected cases increasing exponentially, we may have to witness much bigger devastation before a cure is found. Several promising drug targets have been identified, and several organizations are working relentlessly to develop vaccines against these targets ( Table 1 ). Different available antiviral drugs (repurposed) are being tested for COVID-19 in large clinical trials, as they have shown some positive effects in initial phases ( Table 2 ;  Figure 1 ). Contradictory reports are also started to pouring in against some antiviral therapies targeted at COVID-19, where although initial reports suggested positive effects, later others showed no effect. For example, hydroxychloroquine treatment, along with azithromycin, has shown a significant reduction of viral load in COVID-19 infected patients (Gautret et al., 2020), but subsequent report refutes that claim and showed no benefit in severe COVID-19 patients by this treatment (Molina et al., 2020). Repurposing existing antiviral drugs against COVID-19 has shown some positive effects, but further scientific results are necessary to prove whether these affect COVID-19 treatment, or we are just looking at the placebo effect which can be dangerous for patients.","The emerging COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to the global health care system. Given the lack of antiviral therapies or vaccines for the disease, the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) obtained much attention as a treatment for COVID-19. However, there are limited and uncertain clinical data to support the beneficial effect of this drug in COVID-19 treatment. HCQ has several side effects and warnings, including blindness, heart failure, and renal toxicity, even with recommended doses. For severe cases of COVID-19 or in patients with preexisting conditions, administering such a drug could be fatal, particularly when taken at high doses or in combination with other antibiotics. However, further well-designed studies that would address the optimal dose, duration of treatment, possible side effects, and long-term usage outcomes are needed to make the final decision. In this paper, we aim to discuss the risk of using HCQ in treating COVID-19 patients, including its possible side effects.","The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread throughout the globe by preferentially affecting older individuals with underlying CV comorbidities. Besides ARDS and acute kidney injury, cardiovascular complications also represent a common consequence of the disease and, at the same time, a cause for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients. Although we cannot ignore emerging events of druginduced sudden cardiac death among treated COVID-19 patients (Chorin et al. 2020) , clinical reports well support careful evaluation of the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the onset of severe COVID-19 due to CVD following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include, for example, classical RAS pathway and ACE2, NLRP3\/inflammasome, and hypoxemia (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the prevalence and death toll of COVID-19 increases with aging as well as frailty, and seems correlated with prolonged exposure to air pollution, both of which represent life-threatening CV risk factors. In our opinion, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that exacerbate the impact of COVID-19 in patients with existing CV pathologies and lead to major cardiac complications is mandatory to design a truly cardioprotective therapy while waiting for the vaccine.

Thus, the general reluctance to admit patients with a hematologic malignancy to the ICU, even those with severe critical illness, is currently no longer justified. Not all transplanted patients with ARF can be expected to succumb. In the select, low-risk population of patients with autologous SCT with ARF, survival rates fall within a range that we see for many other diseases that are routinely managed in ICU, such as sepsis-related ARDS [42]. In these patients, dedicated and aggressive support in the early phases of respiratory failure to attempt to establish an etiology seems warranted, allowing the early introduction of specific treatment. Early diagnosis is advantageous, and bronchoscopy, when carefully indicated, substantially increases the diagnostic yield, causing changes in the empirical treatment in the majority of patients [7]. The appropriate timing for withholding or withdrawal of support is probably the most contentious issue surrounding the care of these patients [42]. In patients in whom potential benefits of ICU admission are in doubt, a trial of full intensive ICU management should be given for a limited time period, during which daily evaluation of organ dysfunction may provide a more accurate prediction of survival than at admission [9].","We detail the laboratory data of the hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients at presentation, compared with their steady-state values, before infection with COVID-19 (Tables 2 and 3). We found that patients not hospitalized had minimal changes in their hematologic parameters except for a reduced reticulocyte count; however, patients who required hospitalization had significant alterations in their hematologic parameters, including a significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration (P = .006) and lymphocyte percentage (P = .009), and an increase in NLR (P = .025), from their steady-state values. The NLR is an established marker of systemic inflammation and a validated prognostic factor in several diseases,24,25 including COVID-19, in which a higher NLR is associated with disease severity.26","To set up simple and reliable predictive scores for intensive care admissions and deaths in COVID-19 patients. These scores adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guidelines. Monocentric retrospective cohort study run from early March to end of May in Clinique Saint-Pierre Ottignies, a secondary care hospital located in Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. The outcomes of the study are (i) admission in the Intensive Care Unit and (ii) death. All patients admitted in the Emergency Department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test were included in the study. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at their admission and during their stay. Chest X-Rays and CT-Scans were performed and analyzed by a senior radiologist. A recently published predictive score conducted on a large scale was used as a benchmark value (Liang score) 1 . Logistic regressions were used to develop predictive scores for (i) admission to ICU among emergency ward patients; (ii) death among ICU patients on 40 clinical variables. These models were based on medical intuition and simple model selection tools. Their predictive capabilities were then compared to Liang score. Our results suggest that Liang score may not provide reliable guidance for ICU admission and death. Moreover, the performance of this approach is clearly outperformed by models based on simple markers. For example, a logistic regression considering only the LDH yields to similar sensitivity and greater specificity. Finally, all models considered in this study lead to levels of specificity under or equal to 50%. In our experience, the results of a predictive score based on a large-scale Chinese study cannot be applied in the Belgian population. However, in our small cohort it appears that LDH above 579 UI\/L and venous lactate above 3.02 mmol\/l may be considered as good predictive biological factors for ICU admission. With regards to death risk, NLR above 22.1, tobacco abuse status and 80 % of respiratory impairment appears to be relevant predictive factors. A predictive score for admission to ICU or death is desperately needed in secondary hospitals. Optimal allocation of resources guided by evidence-based indicators will best guide patients at time of admission and avoid futile treatments in intensive care units.","Critically ill patients are at high risk of developing various hematologic complications that may be present on admission or occur during their stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Often times the etiology of specifi c hematologic abnormalities is unclear and the diagnosis may be challenging due to the complexity of critically ill patients. This chapter will focus on diagnosis and management of the most commonly encountered hematologic problems in the critically ill such as anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and thrombotic complications, with specifi c focus on diagnosis and management of these conditions."]},

However, the performance of the currently available tests is plagued by the problem of variability. We have developed a high-throughput serological test capable of simultaneously detecting total immunoglobulins (Ig) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against two of the most immunologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 antigens, nucleocapsid protein (NP) and spike protein (SP) and report its performance in detecting COVID-19 in clinical samples. We designed and prepared reagents for measuring NP-IgG, NP-Total Ig, SP-IgG, and SP-Total Ig (using N-terminally truncated NP (\u0394N-NP) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen) on the advanced chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay system TOSOH AIA-CL.

In addition, strategies to increase sensitivity, specificity, and speed of diagnosis are fundamental.11 ","In this study, different tests were conducted to diagnose and classify COVID-19 cases through chest radiography. The tests were conducted on two types of databases, the first of which included two categories (COVID-19, normal), whereas the second included three categories (COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia). The dataset was divided into two sections (27% for training data and 73% for test data). To evaluate the efficiency and stability of the proposed model, the tests were repeated five times on both types of data. The optimizer (SGD) was used at a 0.001 learning rate, batch size of 32, the momentum of 0.9, and 30 epochs.

However, the immediate source species of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. Here, we used diversity analysis of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has been proved to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for spike protein priming. We also simulated the structure of receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 S RBD) with the ACE2s to investigate their binding affinity to determine the potential intermediate animal hosts that could spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus to humans in South Asia. We identified cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, which are predominant species in the household farming system in South Asia that can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2. All the bird species studied along with rat and mouse were considered less potential to interact with SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and ACE2 protein complex suggests pangolin as a potential intermediate host in SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide a valuable resource for the identification of potential hosts for SARS-CoV-2 in South Asia and henceforth reduce the opportunity for a future outbreak of COVID-19.","Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that binding to ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we propose a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated for the modeled Spike-RBD\/ACE2 complex structures correlated closely with the effectiveness of animal infection as determined by multiple experimental data sets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggest a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggests a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation, but also, more importantly, it proposes a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","The direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of SARS-CoV-2 that caused the COVID-19 pandemic remains elusive. In this work, we developed a computational pipeline to facilitate the identification of potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain and the ACE2 protein of host animals. The effectiveness of this method was verified by its performance at perfectly distinguishing the experimentally determined effective ACE2 receptors from the less effective ones with a maximum Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1.0. Although the sequence identity-based descriptors have been widely used for predicting intermediate hosts, our results showed that their performance for discriminating between effective and less effective receptors was much worse than the binding-affinity-based approach proposed here by achieving a maximum MCC of 0.73. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 may have a broad host range and a few mammals, especially some primates, rodents, and carnivores, rather than the nonmammal animals could be potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, as a supplementary to our previous pangolin coronavirus genome assembly study, the detailed structural modeling here also supports pangolins as a possible intermediate host with molecular-level insights.

We performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells to map the cellular response to the invading virus over time. We identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a dose-dependent activation of Akt, mTOR, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 24 hours post infection (hpi). However, we found a significant inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 through 24hpi and 48hpi of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the Akt\/mTOR\/HIF-1 signaling pathways.

The estimated TMRCA and the associated 95% CIs are both earlier than the outbreak time of COVID-19 in WSM. It is likely that the L and S lineages have been existing for quite a while before the outbreak.","The number of COVID-19 infections worldwide has reached 10 million. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV-1. There is a dispute about the origin of COVID-19. Study results showed that all SARS-CoV-2 sequences around the world share a common ancestor towards the end of 2019. Methods: Virus sequences from COVID-19 samples at the early time should be less diversifiable than those from samples at the later time because there might be more mutations when the virus evolutes over time. The diversity of virus nucleotide sequences can be measured by the nucleotide substitution distance. To explore the diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we use different nucleotide substitution models to calculate the distances of SARS-CoV-2 samples from 3 different areas, China, Europe, and the USA. Then, we use these distances to infer the origin of COVID-19. Results: It is known that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan China and then spread to Europe and the USA. By using different substitution models, the distances of SARS-CoV-2 samples from these areas are significantly different. By ANOVA testing, the p-value is less than 2.2e-16. The analyzed results in most substitution models show that China has the lowest diversity, followed by Europe and lastly by the USA. This outcome coincides with the virus transmission time order that SARS-CoV-2 starts in China, then outbreaks in Europe and finally in the USA. Conclusion: The magnitude of nucleotide substitution distance of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the transmission time order of SARS-CoV-2. This outcome reveals that the nucleotide substitution distance of SARS-CoV-2 may be used to infer the origin of COVID-19.","Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, a 36 controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media.

The current literature suggests that men tend to have a higher risk of severe infection and mortality related to COVID-19. It is believed that elevated estrogen levels in female COVID-19 patients may reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths through an elevation in the innate and humoral response. Furthermore, pre-clinical studies suggest that ACE-2 expression may increase the susceptibility of COVID-19 in pregnant patients. Similarly, the severity and mortality with COVID-19 differ between different ethnic groups. Although genetic polymorphisms associated with COVID-19 susceptibility among ethnic groups remains unknown, the increase in medical comorbidities and lack of access to care are significant contributors to increased COVID-19 mortality in these communities. As the pandemic continues to spread, African American and Hispanic communities have shown increased rates of infection and hospitalization compared to Caucasian populations. These differences are likely due to a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease in minority groups.","Ethnicity data were available for 428,494 participants (235,528 women, 55%) who were alive prior to COVID-19 testing (up to 5 March 2020).

Although not confirmed with cerebrospinal fluid testing, we suspect this patient had COVID-19 meningoencephalitis, highlighting the need to consider secondary headaches in patients with coronavirus infection, even in the setting of chronic migraine. We offer anecdotal treatment recommendations for acutely refractory secondary headache and guidance for the consulting neurologist during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Introduction: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (CO-VID-19) infection has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. The classic presentation of COVID-19 infection was described as fever, myalgia, cough, and fatigue. Whether coronavirus can directly attack the endocrine glands is unclear. Objective: Post-viral subacute thyroiditis (SAT, de Quervain thyroiditis) has been reported following other viral infection. A limited number of SAT after COVID-19 infection have been reported up to now. Methods: Here, we reported 6 patients with SAT and positive COVID-19 serology tests. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, and imaging data were presented. Results: In this study, 6 patients (4 women and 2 men) with clinician manifestations and physical examination in favor of SAT were described. Cervical ultrasonography showed bilateral hypoechoic areas in the thyroid gland which was suggestive of SAT. Elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, free thyroxine, free tri-iodothyronine, and undetectable thyrotropin were found in laboratory evaluations. Both IgM and IgG were positive for COVID-19 infection, but the PCR tests were negative in all patients. Patients had history of working in a COVID center and\/or family member hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were followed up for 1 month and were treated effectively with steroids. Conclusion: This report may help physicians to identify lesserknown manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection results in the prevention of further transmission."]},

Whereas, the most reported clinical presentation are mild to moderate, severe cases can occur in children and death may happen. Paediatric patients might not have fever or cough or shorten of breath. This may present a dangerous situation in the community and accelerate human to human transmission. Social distancing and preventive measures: hand hygiene and home isolation remain important for all age .Doctors should take into considerations these particularities of COVID-19 in children for a better management and be more vigilant in particular when dealing with children presenting at least one underlying condition.","Most pediatric patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms. However, in the last two months, first in Europe and recently in the United States, a small number of children have developed a more severe inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, which often leads to hospitalization and sometimes requires intensive care A potential relationship was observed, especially between the occurrence of the Kawasaki disease and viral upper respiratory tract infections.","Objective Children with neuromuscular disorders have been assumed to be a particularly vulnerable population since the beginning of COVID-19. Although this is a plausible hypothesis, there is no evidence that complications or mortality rates in neuromuscular patients are higher than in the general population. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders. Methods A registry of children with neuromuscular conditions and laboratory-confirmed-SARS-CoV-2 infection was set up by the Neuromuscular Working Group of the Spanish Pediatric Neurology Society (SENEP). Data to be collected were focused on the characteristics and baseline status of the neuromuscular condition and the course of COVID-19. Results Severe complications were not observed in our series of 29 children with neuromuscular disorders infected by SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-nine percent of patients were clinically categorized as asymptomatic or mild cases and 10% as moderate cases. Patients with a relatively more severe course of COVID-19 had SMA type 1 and were between 1 and 3 years. Conclusions The course of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders may not be as severe as expected. The protective role of young age seems to outweigh the risk factors that are common in neuromuscular patients, such as a decreased respiratory capacity or a weak cough. Further studies are needed to know if this finding can be generalized to children with other chronic diseases.","This choice could be supported by the clinical and epidemiological about COVID-19 in children. These data indicate that children are less frequently affected (1.5% of cases) and generally have milder symptoms but they show a persistent positive viral excretion from the gastrointestinal tract after they had recovered [7] . Furthermore, there is an increased risk of critical disease and mortality in children with underlying comorbidities, including chronic neurological disorders.","This choice could be supported by the clinical and epidemiological about COVID-19 in children.

{"body":"Does Vitamin D impact COVID-19 prevention and treatment?","type":"yesno","id":"5fcc1a5230a653d77d00002d","answerReady":true,"snippets":["Novel coronavirus disease pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, for which there is no effective treatment except employing prevention strategies, has already instituted significant number of deaths. In this review, we provide a scientific view on the potential role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 virus\/COVID-19 disease. Vitamin D is well-known to play a significant role in maintaining the immune health of an individual. Moreover, it induces antimicrobial peptide expression that can decrease viral replication and regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory\/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, supplementation of vitamin D has the potential to reduce the incidence, severity and the risk of death from pneumonia resulting from the cytokine storm of many viral infections including COVID-19. We suggest that supplementation of subjects at high risk of COVID-19 with vitamin D (1.000 to 3.000 IU) to maintain its optimum serum concentrations may be of significant benefit for both in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.","This succinct but comprehensive review of the evidence found that despite almost complete absence of official government guidelines favoring vitamin D supplements to potentially decrease COVID-19 risk and severity, support among clinicians and other researchers for correcting and preventing vitamin D deficiency with modest daily vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic is very strong, worldwide. The evidence supports recommending 2,000 IU (50 mcg) vitamin D daily for at-risk teens and adults, which is well within safe limits and might dramatically reduce COVID-19 fatalities.","The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this study was 90% and only 1 patient (10%) had vitamin D insufficiency. There are many health benefits of vitamin D and very few adverse effects. A hypothetical review showed that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for COVID-19. Another randomized controlled trials need to determine and evaluate this recommendation in preventing or treating COVID-19. Clinicians should continue to treat people with vitamin D deficiency especially in managing COVID-19 patients. Ethics approval and consent to participate Ethical clearance certificate was obtained from Bethesda Hospital Yogyakarta; ethical clearance certificate number 18 (EC\/18\/2020). Authorization from Bethesda Hospital was obtained to conduct this study. All patients' privacy and confidentiality were strictly observed throughout the study.","In conclusion, the evidence presented here supports further observational and multicenter well-designed randomized clinical studies on the role of vitamin D in preventing and\/or treating COVID-19 infections. The overlap in the vitamin D associated biological pathways with the dysregulation reported to drive COVID-19 outcomes warrants further investigation, as does the role that vitamin D levels at time of presentation of COVID-19 may have as predictive biomarkers of disease severity. It is important for future work that implications for at-risk populations (BAME, elderly, pregnant, immunocompromised, obese) are taken into consideration when defining the vitamin D dose regimens and duration. Moreover, clinical trials focused on inpatients presenting with COVID-19 are needed to provide a better understanding of the potential of vitamin D as an adjunct treatment.","Vitamin D deficiency co-exists in patients with COVID-19. At this time, dark skin color, increased age, the presence of pre-existing illnesses and vitamin D deficiency are features of severe COVID disease. Of these, only vitamin D deficiency is modifiable. Through its interactions with a multitude of cells, vitamin D may have several ways to reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infections and COVID-19: reducing the survival and replication of viruses, reducing risk of inflammatory cytokine production, increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 concentrations, and maintaining endothelial integrity. Fourteen observational studies offer evidence that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. The evidence to date generally satisfies Hill's criteria for causality in a biological system, namely, strength of association, consistency, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility (e.g., mechanisms), and coherence, although experimental verification is lacking. Thus, the evidence seems strong enough that people and physicians can use or recommend vitamin D supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19 in light of their safety and wide therapeutic window. In view of public health policy, however, results of large-scale vitamin D randomized controlled trials are required and are currently in progress."]},
{"body":"Should assisted reproduction be avoided during the Covid-19 pandemic?","type":"yesno","id":"5fccd5fd30a653d77d000037","answerReady":true,"snippets":["The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique concerns and potential risks to women now pregnant or considering childbearing. Although no professional societies have issued recommendations that women avoid conception at this time, several professional organizations recommended a moratorium on infertility services including both medically assisted reproduction and assisted reproductive technology shortly after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 infection to be a pandemic. Reasons cited for undertaking these extraordinary measures included prevention of possible complications of assisted reproductive technology and medically assisted reproduction and virus induced complications of pregnancy including potential vertical transmission to the fetus and optimization use of critical health care resources. A survey of reproductive health providers in 97 countries was undertaken to assess their response to the pandemic and recently issued guidance. Although different countries reacted differently with diverse responses and variable resources, the results suggest that the reproductive health community has largely been responsive to public health and individual patient concerns.","One of the groups that is most vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic is pregnant women. They cannot choose to refrain from care; they and their children are at risk of severe complications related to the virus; and they lose comfort and support as clinics prohibit their partners and as societal restrictions demand isolation from friends and relatives. It is urgent to study how this group is faring during the pandemic and we focus here on their health-related worries. A longitudinal survey at a Swedish hospital starting six months before (16 September 2019) and continuing during the COVID-19 outbreak (until 25 August 2020). 6,941 pregnant women and partners of diverse social backgrounds were recruited. 96 which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. 2 percent of birth-giving women in the city take early ultrasounds where recruitment took place. 62 percent of the women with an appointment and 51 percent of their partners gave consent to participate. Results: Pregnant women experienced dramatically increased worries for their own health, as well as for their partner's and their child's health in the beginning of the pandemic. The worries remained at higher than usual levels throughout the pandemic. Similar, but less dramatic changes, were seen among partners. There is a need for heightened awareness of pregnant women's and partners' health-related worries as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Related feelings such as anxiety have been linked to adverse pregnancy outcome and might have long-term effects. The health care system needs to prepare for follow-up visits with these families.","The current pandemic due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has forced physicians to review their current clinical practice and guidelines. Although elective procedures using assisted reproductive technologies (ART) should be preferably canceled or postponed at this time, this does not always apply to urgent procedures such as those in patients with cancer. A complete oncofertility counseling balancing the benefits and risks of undergoing fertility preservation before commencing gonadotoxic therapies (chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy) should also be provided during the COVID-19 outbreak. This article briefly highlights what patients, oncologists and fertility specialists need to keep in mind during oncofertility counseling at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak.","To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, much emphasis exists on implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions to keep the reproduction number below one. But using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significative economic and societal costs. Here we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the maximum health services' capacity. To explore the implications of our theoretical results, we study the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 16 cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of the contact rate in each city that is necessary to control the epidemic optimally. We also compare the optimal start of the intervention with the start of the actual interventions applied in each city. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to guide the design of non-pharmaceutical intervention policies.","The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled numerous debates in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART) as the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy and infancy is still considered uncharted territory. Various theses and recommendations on what optimal practice is have emerged, as evidenced by surveys, webinars, and recent publications. ART specialists are faced with dilemmas in light of the lack of concrete scientific evidence required to pave the way towards future safe practice. Meanwhile, infertile couples were similarly left in limbo unable to exercise their reproductive autonomy unlike fertile couples-where achieving a pregnancy via natural conception is a matter of decision. ART treatment being classified as non-essential has only recently re-started, facing new challenges while enabling pregnancy at a time of uncertainty. This article highlights matters of bioethical nature to be considered in the ART world at the time of COVID-19 while presenting an all-inclusive critique of the current status. When pursuing pregnancy through IVF treatment during the pandemic, distancing and caution have the lead role in an effort to defend the health of the intended parents and future children. To promote patient autonomy along with our ethical, moral, and legal duty towards our patients, emphasis should be given on ascertaining shared decision-making, and ensuring that an appropriate all-inclusive informed consent is signed prior to initiating any IVF treatment."]},
{"body":"Is there a way to distinguish COVID-19 clinically from other respiratory illnesses, particularly influenza?","type":"yesno","id":"5fccf96530a653d77d000041","answerReady":true,"snippets":["We compared symptoms and characteristics of 4961 ambulatory patients with and without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings indicate that clinical symptoms alone would be insufficient to distinguish between COVID-19 and other respiratory infections (e.g., influenza) and\/or to evaluate the effects of preventive interventions (e.g., vaccinations). for use under a CC0 license.","COVID-19 is a pandemic viral disease with catastrophic global impact. This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea\/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided.","Background: There is an urgent need to rapidly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory conditions, including influenza, at first-presentation. Point-of-care tests not requiring laboratory-support will speed diagnosis and protect health-care staff. We studied the feasibility of using breath-analysis to distinguish these conditions with near-patient gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Methods: Independent observational prevalence studies at Edinburgh, UK, and Dortmund, Germany, recruited adult patients with possible COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Participants gave a single breathsample for VOC analysis by GC-IMS. COVID-19 infection was identified by transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of oral\/nasal swabs together with clinical-review. Following correction for environmental contaminants, potential COVID-19 breath-biomarkers were identified by multi-variate analysis and comparison to GC-IMS databases. A COVID-19 breath-score based on the relative abundance of a panel of volatile organic compounds was proposed and tested against the cohort data. Findings: Ninety-eight patients were recruited, of whom 21\/33 (63.6%) and 10\/65 (15.4%) had COVID-19 in Edinburgh and Dortmund, respectively. Other diagnoses included asthma, COPD, bacterial pneumonia, and cardiac conditions. Multivariate analysis identified aldehydes (ethanal, octanal), ketones (acetone, butanone), and methanol that discriminated COVID-19 from other conditions. An unidentified-feature with significant predictive power for severity\/death was isolated in Edinburgh, while heptanal was identified in Dortmund. Differentiation of patients with definite diagnosis (25 and 65) of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 was possible with 80% and 81.5% accuracy in Edinburgh and Dortmund respectively (sensitivity\/specificity 82.4%\/75%; area-under-the-receiver-operator-characteristic [AUROC] 0.87 95% CI 0.67 to 1) and Dortmund (sensitivity \/ specificity 90%\/80%; AUROC 0.91 95% CI 0.87 to 1). Interpretation: These two studies independently indicate that patients with COVID-19 can be rapidly distinguished from patients with other conditions at first healthcare contact. The identity of the marker compounds is consistent with COVID-19 derangement of breath-biochemistry by ketosis, gastrointestinal effects, and inflammatory processes. Development and validation of this approach may allow rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in the coming endemic flu seasons.","Background: Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, considerable attention has been paid on its epidemiology and clinical characteristics in children patients. However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses. Methods: This was a retrospective study. Two group of COVID-19 patients (n=57) and influenza A patients (n=59) were enrolled. We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics and treatments. The proportions of cough (70.2%), fever (54.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (14.1%) in COVID-19 patients were lower than those of influenza A patients (98.3%, P < 0.001; 84.7%, P <0.001; and 35.6%, P = 0.007; respectively). In addition, COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower levels of leukocytes (7.87 vs. 9.89 \u00d710 9 \/L, P = 0.027), neutrophils (2.43 vs. 5.16 \u00d710 9 \/L, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP; 3.7 vs. 15.1 mg\/L, P = 0.001) and procalcitonin (PCT; 0.09 vs. 0.68 mm\/h, P < 0.001), while lymphocyte levels (4.58 vs. 3.56 \u00d7109\/L; P = 0.006) were significantly higher compared with influenza A patients. In terms of CT imaging, ground-glass opacification in chest CT was more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza A patients (42.1% vs. 15%, P = 0.032). In contrast, consolidation was more common in influenza A patients (25%) than that in COVID-19 patients (5.2%, P = 0.025). The clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of COVID-19 children are milder than those of influenza A children under 5 years. Additionally, imaging results more commonly presented as ground-glass opacities in COVID-19 patients.","COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation."]},

","The human infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 is a public health emergency of international concern. Although the disease associated to this virus, named COVID-19, mainly affects the lungs, the infection can spread to extrapulmonary tissues, causing multiorgan involvement in severely ill patients. The broad infective capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is related to the pattern of expression of the viral entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human tissues. As such, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which explains the clinical phenotype described in the vast majority of infected patients that includes pneumonia and diarrhea. Recently, preoccupation about the potential of the virus to infect the skin has been raised by dermatologists due to the increasing observations of cutaneous manifestations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although there is little evidence of the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the normal skin, the dermatological findings observed among COVID-19 patients warrants further investigation to delineate the mechanisms of skin affection after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we provide a summary of the dermatological findings observed among patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on recent reports. In addition, we analyze possible mechanisms of skin injury in COVID-19 patients and discuss about the risk of individuals with chronic skin conditions for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This is certainly due to many factors, including the aggressiveness of the type of tumor and the side effects of cancer treatment. Here we provide additional evidence suggesting that tumor tissues are less prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than non-tumorous tissues, due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. Furthermore, this reduction is more evident in HNSCC patients with shorter overall survival as well as those with HPV negative status and TP53 mutations.","Clinically, it is increasingly evident that cancer patients represent at least in part, the most vulnerable population target of SARS-CoV-2 infection [5, 37].

Recent data comprising 3,199 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and controls reproduce this and find that it is the major genetic risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization (COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative). Here, we show that the risk is conferred by a genomic segment of ~50 kb that is inherited from Neandertals and occurs at a frequency of ~30% in south Asia and ~8% in Europe.","In this study, we explore the physiological significance of the COVID-19 severity associated genetic variants using detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics data from large cohorts. Our findings allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy. A recent genome-wide association study of European ancestry has identified 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 (ABO gene) to be significantly associated with COVID-19 respiratory failure (1). Here, we employed the detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics data of the Human Functional Genomics Projects (HFGP) to explore the physiological significance of the host genetic variants that influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. A functional genomics investigation based on functional characterization of individuals with high genetic risk for severe COVID-19 susceptibility identified several major patterns: i. a large impact of genetically determined innate immune responses in COVID-19, with increased susceptibility for severe disease in individuals with defective monocyte-derived cytokine production; ii. genetic susceptibility related to ABO blood groups is probably mediated through the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelial dysfunction; and iii. the increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 in men is at least partially mediated by chromosome X-mediated genetic variation. These insights allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy.","Genome-wide association studies have shown that progression of COVID-19 to respiratory failure is associated with locus 3p21.31, spanning the genes solute carrier family 6 member 20 (SLC6A20), leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1 (LZTFL1), C-C motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), FYVE and coiled-coil domain autophagy adaptor 1 (FYCO1), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) and X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (XCR1), as well as with locus 9q34.2 coinciding with the alpha 1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and alpha 1-3-galactosyltransferase (ABO) blood group locus, but no association with 19q.13.3, where FPR1 is located.38Another study demonstrated that SNPs affecting angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and two key host factors of SARS-CoV-2 were likely associated with the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19.39,40 Thus, the literature published during the execution of this study confirms the conjecture that SNPs in FPR1 have no major disease-modulatory role in COVID-19.41","Hyperimmune activation and \"cytokine storm\" are present in cases of severe COVID-19. In this pandemic, the goal is to identify host genomic factors that increase susceptibility or resistance to the complications of the disease, and to translate these findings in a timely manner to improved patient care. 42 As various approaches are being taken to uncover biological networks underlying host-pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) interactions and common variants therein, it may be important to consider that common variants occur in some of those networks, which have been characterized to play functionally significant roles in other global epidemic diseases. In this regard, the role of certain polymorphisms within as well as outside CCR5 in HIV\/AIDS may be worth considering. This region contains CCR5 and several functionally significant SNPs including rs1015164. 17, 18 It also includes the 335 kb region (chr3:45800446-46135604, Hg38 [chr3:45841938-46177096, Hg19]) containing the rs11385942 insertion-deletion GA\/A SNP, which was found to be associated with COVID-19-induced respiratory failure. 7 Therefore, further characterization of this chromosomal region in COVID-19 patients seems warranted.","Rhesus and Kell blood groups were not associated with seropositivity. In a paper that appeared following the submission of our manuscript, Ellinghaus D. et al. (2020) conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and identified a 3p21.31 gene cluster as a genetic susceptibility locus in patients with severe clinical presentations. The association signal suggests a higher risk in blood group A and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups."]},

Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and\/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals. Pathogens 2020, 9, 529 2 of 22 porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (HEV; \u03b2-CoV) [8] and porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV; \u03b2-CoV) [9] in swine; bovine CoV (BCoV, \u03b2-CoV) in cattle [10]; canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV; \u03b1-CoV) [11] and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV; \u03b2-CoV) [12] in dogs; feline coronavirus (FCoV; \u03b1-CoV) in cats [13]; and murine hepatitis virus (MHV; \u03b2-CoV) in mice [14] (Table 1). 1.1.2. Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) There are four established coronaviruses (HCoVs) that can infect humans, namely HCoV-E299 (\u03b1-CoV), HCoV-NL63 (\u03b1-CoV), HCoV-OC43 (\u03b2-CoV) and HCoV-HKU1 (\u03b2-CoV) ( Table 1) . Human infections with any of these four viruses are relatively mild and constitute 10-30% of the causative agents of the common cold in humans [15] [16] [17] . Nevertheless, the infection with HCoVs can cause lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), with serious consequences in the young, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [18] . Although HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been in circulation for a long time in several countries, they were only discovered after 2003, in the post-SARS era [19] . Interestingly, HCoV-OC43 and bovine BCoV shared 95% genetic identity, indicating zoonotic transmission from cattle to humans 100 years ago. Bovine-to-human, and not human-to-bovine, transmission of HCoV-OC43 is supported by the presence of a 290-nucleotide deletion in HCoV-OC43, which was absent in BCoV, suggesting adaptive changes after jumping the species barrier to humans [20] . Moreover, human infections with three animal origin \u03b2-CoVs, namely HCoV-SARS, HCoV-MERS and the most recent CoV, SARS-CoV-2, were reported to induce severe LRTIs in humans [1]. Certain animals (see below) are also vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 because the same Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is used, and this receptor is quite conserved across mammals [21] [22] [23] .","In the months after COVID-19 was reported on all continents (except Antarctica) and designated a human pandemic by the WHO, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a small number of animals who had been exposed to infected humans or challenged experimentally. These include domesticated cats, dogs, and ferrets, and captive-managed mink, lions, and tigers, suggesting zooanthroponosis (8, 29\u201332). Four domesticated cats (one each in Hong Kong, Belgian, French and American cities) and three dogs (two in Hong Kong, and one in the USA) all belonging to COVID-19-positive owners tested positive (29). Experimental studies have shown that cats, ferrets, and primates are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and can transmit the virus. Zoo animals including a tiger and a lion were reported to have been infected by their zoo career (8, 33, 34). Zooanthroponotic infections (human to mink) occurred in the Netherlands, Denmark and Spain, and mink-to-human transmission has been suggested (29, 35) leading to the slaughter of all mink on infected farms. This raises the possibility of wider dissemination and future involvement of multiple species in SARS-CoV-2 circulation and persistence, but few studies have been completed thus far (36\u201338). Thus, evidence to date indicates that SARS-CoV-2 should not be considered a zoonosis and wildlife should not be the default culprit not only for COVID-19 but for other inappropriately labeled zoonoses.","Risk factors for COVID-19 are still largely unknown, however, it is believed that the virus was transmitted to humans via contaminated live animals (snakes, civet cats). All three beta coronaviruses emerged via zoonotic transmission. Risk factors for zoonotic transmission of SARS and MERS were direct contact with infected animals. The suspected reservoir hosts are currently believed to be bats, similar to the SARS epidemic. The focal point of the epidemic is the Huanan seafood market. SARS was also hypothesized to have arisen from one of these types of markets. These commonalities may signal the need for closure of these wholesale markets in China. China has a long history of live-animal markets considered vital to communities across the country. As such, it is unlikely that these markets will be closed permanently, although their closure would be the strongest deterrent to another zoonotic disease outbreak. Re-opening of these markets should be under strict purview of the CCDCP, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure health and hygiene protocols that limit live-animal and human contact are used. Surveillance of these markets may be vital for controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases. Surveillance activities may be similar to that of novel influenza viruses undertaken by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention."]},

There were socio-economic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. Many smokers reported smoking more than usual, and COVID-19-related stress was associated with increased smoking, particularly among those with no post-16 qualifications.","A study in Iran showed that among 193 confirmed COVID-19 patients, more than half of cigarette smokers and 40% of waterpipe smokers reported their COVID-19 symptoms as severe compared to 22% of never-smokers [34]. In a retrospective study, an observational cohort study of 112 in-patient adults, diagnosed with COVID-19, between March 12 and April 16, 2020, in Los Angeles, smoking history along with obesity and elevated inflammatory markers was associated with an increased need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 [35]. Another retrospective cohort study, conducted between February 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020 in Kuwait indicated that asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in COVID-19 patients [36]. A study of critically ill 59 covid-19 patients, hospitalized in ICU in Japan, clearly predicted that patients with older age and smoking history have a higher incidence of multiple organ injuries, more deteriorative lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, remarkably impaired cellular immune response, and strengthened cytokine release [37]. A community-based cohort study of 387,109 adults in the UK reported smoking as a lifestyle risk factors for cardiovascular disease in relation to covid-19 hospitalization [38], however, smokers have reported to have a lower adherence to WHO recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus [39].","J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Abstract The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on infectious diseases and their associations with host factors and underlying conditions. New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades' worth of multi-center epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.","The association between population size and COVID-19 CFR may imply the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries with large populations. The observed association between smoking in females and COVID-19 CFR might be due to that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly income level of a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine and\/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations. Spatial dependence and temporal \uf0b7 Asymptomatic carriers and victims of COVID-19 were not taken into account in the analysis.","Of the sample, 0.29% (95% CI 0.25% to 0.34%) reported having (had) a confirmed case of COVID-19 and a further 10.3% (95% CI 10.0% to 10.5%) reported experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Compared with never smokers, prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current smokers but not ex-smokers, and associations were similar after adjustment. Associations between smoking status and confirmed COVID-19 differed significantly by level of education. Odds of confirmed COVID-19 were 3.5 times higher among current smokers with no post-16 qualifications than never smokers after adjustment for covariates, but they did not differ significantly by smoking status among participants with post-16 qualifications (table 2)."]},

The digital solutions of automated COVID-19 screening, daily symptom monitoring, web-based care, and knowledge access have commendable acceptability and feasibility for complementing offline hospital services and facilitating disease control and prevention. Future studies to evaluate the effects of relevant functions on practical applications and formulate relevant policies and measures to enhance the application of digital health technologies are of paramount importance.","Digital proxies of human mobility and physical mixing have been used to monitor viral transmissibility and effectiveness of social distancing interventions in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a new framework that parameterizes disease transmission models with agespecific digital mobility data. By fitting the model to case data in Hong Kong, we were able to accurately track the local effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in near real time (i.e. no longer constrained by the delay of around 9 days between infection and reporting of cases) which is essential for quick assessment of the effectiveness of interventions on reducing transmissibility.

We conducted a rapid literature review searching PubMed and MedrXiv with terms considered adequate to find relevant literature on the use of digital technologies in response to COVID-19. Results. The search identified 52 articles, of which 38 full-text articles were assessed and 29 included in the review after screening. Of selected articles, most of them addressed the use of digital technologies for diagnosis, surveillance and prevention. We report that digital solutions and innovative technologies have mainly been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In particular, within the reviewed articles we identified numerous suggestions on the use of artificial intelligence-powered tools for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19. Digital technologies are useful also for prevention and surveillance measures, for example through contact-tracing apps or monitoring of internet searches and social media usage. Discussion.

{"body":"Is the coronavirus spike protein mutating?","type":"yesno","id":"5fca6abd30a653d77d000022","answerReady":true,"snippets":["The spike (S) protein of murine coronavirus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is a type I membrane protein that induces membrane fusion. In this study we have analyzed the role of two domains in the S protein on fusion. The 180-kDa mature S protein is partially cleaved into two 90-kDa subunits during transport to the plasma membrane. We have identified several amino acids that are important for cleavage of S, and we show that cleavage is not strictly required for fusion. However, the level of cleavage seems to influence the fusion kinetics. After introduction of an arginine at position P 2 to mimick the MHV-JHM cleavage site, full cleavage of the spike protein was obtained. Further, we analyzed the effect of mutations in the transmembrane (TM) domain of the S protein. Maturation and cell surface expression of the mutant proteins were not affected, and all proteins became acylated. The mutant in which the predicted transmembrane domain was shortened did not induce syncytia. From a group of mutants in which several conserved cysteines in the TM domain had been replaced by serines, one was unable to induce syncytia, another showed delayed syncytia formation, and the third mutant induced syncytia as did the wild-type protein. The potential role of the transmembrane domain in fusion is discussed. \u1b67","The coronavirus genome encodes for 29 proteins (one may not get expressed): Four structural proteins (Spike, envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid) and 25 non-structural proteins [24,25]. The Spike protein\/S-protein binds to cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of the host cells for entry into the host cells [26]. The non-structural proteins are mainly involved in the virus assembly, replication, and modulation of the host system and initially expressed as two long polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins were further protested into 16 smaller proteins with the help of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and papain-like protease. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro performs 11 of these cleavages, thus, it is an attractive target for the drug discovery against COVID-19 [7,8]. The other non-structural proteins involved in the life-cycle of coronavirus is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase and NSP3 protein that associated with immunomodulation of host system to protect the virus. The structural spike glycoprotein and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, papain-like protease, RdRp, helicase, and NSP3 are an important target for anti-COVID drugs [27]. The spike protein contains an exposed Cys-136 residue and twelve disulfides (PDB ID:6VXX) and further, Cys-136 residue is the distance from the binding surface with ACE2. Interestingly, the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and papain-like protease contains cysteine residue. The catalytic motif of Mpro consists of dyad residues (His-41 and Cys-145) [7,8] and papain-like protease consists of triad residue (Cys-111, His-272, and Asp-287) [28]. The covalent modification of active site cysteine residues in these proteases results in functional loss which eventually terminates the formation of non-structural proteins and replication of coronavirus. Using in silico approach, the present studies have evaluated the allicin as a covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The reactive nature of allicin and its reaction by-products with cysteine thiols results in the dual S-thioallylation of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Thus, allicin may attenuate the replication of coronavirus and may be useful in attenuating the COVID-19. Synergistic effects of allicin induced S-thioallylation of coronavirus proteins may play a role in attenuating the replication and propagation of coronavirus.","Spike protein is one of the major structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. It is essential for the interaction of the virons with host cell receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelop with host cell membrane to allow infection. Some spike proteins of coronavirus, such as MHV, HCoV-OC43, AIBV and BcoV, are proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2. In contrast, TGV, FIPV and HCoV-229E are not. Many studies have shown that the cleavage of spike protein seriously affects its function. In order to investigate the maturation and proteolytic processing of the S protein of SARS CoV, we generated S1 and S2 subunit specific antibodies (Abs) as well as N, E and 3CL protein-specific Abs. Our results showed that the antibodies could efficiently and specifically bind to their corresponding proteins from E.coli expressed or lysate of SARS-CoV infected Vero-E6 cells by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the anti-S1 and S2 Abs were proved to be capable of binding to SARS CoV under electron microscope observation. When S2 Ab was used to perform immune precipitation with lysate of SARS-CoV infected cells, a cleaved S2 fragment was detected with S2-specific mAb by Western blot analysis. The data demonstrated that the cleavage of S protein was observed in the lysate, indicating that proteolytic processing of S protein is present in host cells.","Sequence analysis of the TMD of coronavirus spike proteins reveals a high conservation rate. In Figure 1A , an alignment is shown of the transmembrane domains of several coronavirus spike proteins, of which at least one virus of each group is included. Evidently, the aromatic and cysteine domains are conserved between CoVs. To investigate the roles of the aromatic domain in SARS CoV spike-mediated entry, we performed an extensive muta-genesis on the spike TMD. The mutants that were generated are listed in Figure 1B .","Coronavirus spike proteins are the primary antigenic signatures on coronaviruses as they contribute to the characteristic crown-like morphology underlining this virus family. As these proteins comprise the outermost layer of coronaviruses, the spike proteins have a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis and are recognized as the primary target for vaccine preparations [44]. Present vaccination strategies for coronaviruses include recombinant viruses and virus-like particles, and there is a continuing effort in developing new strategies for improving vaccine potency and safety [22]. To the best of our knowledge, incorporating coronavirus spike protein with synthetic nanoparticles has not been previously explored. By exploiting the high surface energies of synthetic nanoparticles, spontaneous assembly of sVLPs covered with IBV spike proteins were demonstrated. The strong particle\/antigen association resulted in virus-sized particulates displaying IBV spike proteins, and the sVLPs elicited strong immune protection against a live IBV challenge. The enhanced immunopotentiation by the particle carrier is consistent with previous studies and echoes the curious observation that gold nanoparticles not only promote humoral but also cellular immune responses upon association with antigens [14], [15]. As the increased cellular immune response suggests that the nanoparticles may play a role beyond a passive antigen carrier, future studies examining the impact of nanomaterials and nanoparticle surface energies on immunological interactions are warranted."]},
{"body":"will SARS-CoV2 infected people develop immunity? Is cross protection possible?","type":"yesno","id":"5fcc19eb30a653d77d00002c","answerReady":true,"snippets":["The discovery of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in non-infected individuals indicates cross-reactive immune memory from prior exposure to human coronaviruses (HCoV) that cause the common cold. This raises the possibility that \"immunity\" could exist within populations at rates that may be higher than serology studies estimate. Besides specialized research labs, however, there is limited ability to measure HCoV CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which currently impedes interpretation of any potential correlation between COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and the calibration of pandemic control measures. Given this limited testing ability, an alternative approach would be to exploit the large cohort of currently available data from which statistically significant associations may be generated. This would necessitate the merging of several public databases including patient and contact tracing, which could be created by relevant public health organizations. Including data from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in SARS-CoV-2 databases and surveillance systems could provide the necessary information to allow for more informed decisions.","COVID-19 caused by SARS CoV2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and soon become a pandemic. Since the virus is novel, pre-existing CoV2-specific immunity is not expected to exist in humans, although studies have shown presence of CoV2 crossreactive T cells in unexposed individuals. Lack of effective immunity in most individuals along with high infectiousness of the virus has resulted in massive global public health emergency. Intense efforts are on to study viral pathogenesis and immune response to help guide prophylactic and therapeutic interventions as well as epidemiological assessments like transmission modeling. To develop an effective vaccine or biologic therapeutic, it is critical to understand the immune correlates of COVID-19 control. At the same time, whether immunity in recovered individuals is effective for preventing reinfection will be important for informing interventions like social distancing. Key questions that are being investigated regarding immune response in COVID-19 which will help these efforts include, investigations of immune response that distinguishes patients with severe versus mild infection or those that recover relative to those that succumb, durability of immunity in recovered patients and relevance of developed immunity in a cured patient for protection against re-infection as well as value of convalescent plasma from recovered patients as a potential therapeutic modality. This is a broad and rapidly evolving area and multiple reports on status of innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV2 are emerging on a daily basis. While many questions remain unanswered for now, the purpose of this focused review is to summarize the current understanding regarding immune correlates of COVID-19 severity and resolution in order to assist researchers in the field to pursue new directions in prevention and control.","Elicitation of effective cross-reactive T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, particularly CD8 T cell responses, would allow the host to clear the virus quickly and exhibit milder courses of COVID-19. However, children appear to be largely unaffected by the virus, which is consistent with having protective antibody immunity blocking and limiting viral infection. Interestingly, such protective immunity could also result from cross-reactive antibodies elicited by combination DTP vaccines. Thus, we found 16 SARS-CoV-2 peptide matches with DTP antigens, mapping in ectodomains of virion surface antigens and of those, 14 are in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Table 6). None of the SARS-CoV-2 peptide matches mapping in virion surface antigens are from aP antigens, while 11 are from wP, highlighting the superiority of DTwP vaccines in eliciting potentially protective cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that some SARS-CoV-2 peptide matches such as FEYVSQPF are not predicted as B cell epitopes (B < 0.4) but yet could be readily recognized by antibodies as shown by the computed solvent accessibilities (Table 6). B cell epitope predictions methods are in general quite unreliable, and actual solvent accessibilities values are better measures of potential B cell reactivity.","Given other HCoVs are likely to provide levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2 via cross-reactive immune memory, it is important to maintain levels of immunity to the broader spectrum of HCoVs in the current environment. If the spread of other mild respiratory and HCoV-related infections in school is reduced from normal levels, what impact will this have on the normal transmission of the \u201ccommon cold\u201d between children and those with whom they reside, as well as the wider community? Could this lead to a reduction in the temporary buildup of cross-reactive T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 that could provide some vital protection in an older, higher risk population, particularly given the reduced level of T-cell diversity and loss of immunity to previous HCoV infections as individuals age? While speculative at this stage, it is possible that differential spread of respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 within the younger population could be beneficial for their older relatives.","Previous reports have suggested that immunity for other coronaviruses may confer a certain degree of protection against endemic coronaviruses.19 Hence, we explored the possibility that serum specimens from individuals diagnosed with OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 coronavirus infections (Fig. 4A) but not infected with SARS-CoV-2 could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2. However, we found that none of the tested samples showed neutralizing activity above the cutoff of detection (Fig. 4B), suggesting the absence of cross-neutralization between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses."]},

Therefore, higher level of airborne particulate matters may increase the transmission of COVID-19.","SARS-CoV-2 is typically transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person or from touching eyes, nose, or mouth after touching virus-contaminated surfaces. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through aerosols and direct contact has also been demonstrated in a Syrian hamster model (14, 20). We additionally explored whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the fecal\u2212oral route. To this end, hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with virus were euthanized at day 1 or day 3 pi. Subsequently, sentinel hamsters were housed in the used cages of the index hamsters (food grids and water bottles were replaced by fresh ones) and euthanized at day 4 postexposure. Although viral RNA and infectious virus could readily be detected in tissues from index hamsters (except in two stool samples), the majority of sentinel hamsters did not become infected, as shown by the absence of viral RNA and infectious virus in lung and ileum (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). This indicates that the fecal\u2212oral route only marginally contributes to the transmission SARS-CoV-2 between hamsters, thereby confirming the results of a previous study (20). We therefore continued by focusing on transmission of the virus via direct contact only.","In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious and pathogenic virus. It can be transmitted through contact and air, and may also be transmitted via mother-to-fetus and fecal-oral transmission routes. Although a variety of candidate medicines have been applied in clinical trials, the efficacy of these drugs still needs further research, especially in double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.","In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious and pathogenic virus.

Initially, the proposed main transmission routes were direct, through cough, sneeze, and respiratory droplets, as well as contact with mucous membranes of eyes, nose, or oral cavity [12,14,15]. Recent studies demonstrated high loads of virus RNA in hospital aerosol [16]. Moreover, particles generated by asymptomatic carriers while speaking are increasingly considered to be a major mode of transmission as the virus remained suspended in air for 10s of minutes or even longer [17,18,19]. Hence, 9 cases out of 10 of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been estimated to be airborne. This is in-line with recent findings revealing substantial virus load in the oral mucosa and in stimulated saliva from submandibular gland duct [20,21]. Comparable virus loads were reported for children and adults [22], thus suggesting that children may be as infectious as adults."]},

Amongst these trials, 34 were from the European Union database of clinical trials and 26 from the National Institute of health. The data selection procedure includes active, completion, and recruitment in progress status. Most of the clinical trials are ongoing and hence, there is a lack of precise results for the treatment. There is a lack of high-quality clinical evidence. The protocol to be developed requires large randomized clinical trials with a combination of available drugs and prospective therapies.

There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, various antiviral and immunomodulating agents are in various stages of evaluation for COVID-19 in those trials and some of them will be published in the next couple of months.

The vaccine AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) developed jointly by Oxford University and AstraZeneca provides double protection against COVID-19 by producing both antibodies and T-cells that directly kill infected cells (Beyrer et al., 2012). Another vaccine (Ad5-nCOV) developed by CanSino Biologics, China, also shown to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020). These reports instill faith that a protective vaccine would be available soon to ease the suffering that the world is facing today because of COVID-19.","A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might represent the most promising approach to halt durably the current COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that anti-CD20 therapy may jeopardize the efficacy of such a vaccine. This is regrettable because patients receiving anti-CD20 therapy (i.e. those with hematologic malignancies or autoimmune disorders) are particularly at risk of severe COVID-19 and, as such, are the most in need of a vaccine.","There are several new vaccines and novel therapeutic molecules which are currently under development against COVID-19 ( Tables 1  and  2 ). The finding of a safe and attractive target for vaccine development is of utmost importance at this point to prevent further spread of this virus. Unfortunately, the way SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world and infected cases increasing exponentially, we may have to witness much bigger devastation before a cure is found. Several promising drug targets have been identified, and several organizations are working relentlessly to develop vaccines against these targets ( Table 1 ). Different available antiviral drugs (repurposed) are being tested for COVID-19 in large clinical trials, as they have shown some positive effects in initial phases ( Table 2 ;  Figure 1 ). Contradictory reports are also started to pouring in against some antiviral therapies targeted at COVID-19, where although initial reports suggested positive effects, later others showed no effect. For example, hydroxychloroquine treatment, along with azithromycin, has shown a significant reduction of viral load in COVID-19 infected patients (Gautret et al., 2020), but subsequent report refutes that claim and showed no benefit in severe COVID-19 patients by this treatment (Molina et al., 2020). Repurposing existing antiviral drugs against COVID-19 has shown some positive effects, but further scientific results are necessary to prove whether these affect COVID-19 treatment, or we are just looking at the placebo effect which can be dangerous for patients.","It should be noted that the development of a COVID-19 vaccine has been on a fast track. Thus far, four non-replicating viral vector vaccines, three inactivated vaccines and two mRNA vaccines being under clinical phase III stage, with more are on the way (32). Though different types of adjuvants have been used in exploratory and pre-clinical studies ( Tables 1 \u2013 3 ), considering the need for rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines for the pandemic, alum, which had been formulated in many other licensed vaccines, have been prioritized (15, 16). In addition to the adjuvants described above, engineered nanomaterials also shed light adjuvant development. It has been shown that physicochemical characteristics of aluminum oxyhydroxide could affect the optimal immunogenicity profiles of vaccine formulations (41, 83, 84). Moreover, a recent study has shown that an alum-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PAPE) showed robust RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG2a titers and a high level of inducing IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells in a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, it has been shown that a natural and potent STING agonist encapsulated by pulmonary biomimetic liposomes triggered rapid humoral and cellular immune responses and exhibited a sustained cross-protection against influenza (76). However, more comprehensive mechanistic studies, including the nature of protective immune responses and screening of the various combinations of antigens and adjuvants, are needed for the successful development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.","At the moment, treatment of COVID-19 unfortunately has more shadows than lights. The basic treatments are mainly represented by antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine, or lopinavir\/ritonavir, even if the evidence for their use is not satisfactory. Among the antiviral agents, the most promising appears to be remdesivir, though this needs to be confirmed by ongoing RCTs. However, many questions remain open about pathogenesis, the molecular mechanism of input, viral replication, and immunological pathways, in order to identify targeted therapies. Corticosteroids and tocilizumab seem to guarantee positive results in selected patients so far, although the timing of starting therapy and the most appropriate therapeutic schemes remain to be clarified. Efficacy of the other drugs is still uncertain, and they are currently used in combination and in variable ways in the absence of definitive guidelines. What will represent the real solution to the enormous problem taking place worldwide is the identification of a safe and effective vaccine, for which enormous efforts and investments are underway."]},

These variations can be observed 24 in the population of viral sequences isolated from infected host cells and are not necessarily 25 reflected in the genome of transmitted founder viruses. We profiled intra-sample genetic diversity 26 of SARS-CoV-2 variants using 15,289 high-throughput sequencing datasets from infected 27 individuals and infected cell lines. Most of the genetic variations observed, including C->U and 28 G->U, were consistent with errors due to heat-induced DNA damage during sample processing, 29 and\/or sequencing protocols.

Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen using pairwise tagging algorithms. The frequencies of four tag SNPs (rs12711521, rs2261695, rs2273346 and rs7548659) were ascertained in 376 SARS patients and 523 control subjects, using the Beckman SNPstream Ultra High Throughput genotyping platform.

Previous studies 4 have suggested that different host genetic backgrounds in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 could 5 contribute to differences in the rate of infection or severity of COVID-19. Recent studies 6 also showed that variants in 15 genes related to type I interferon immunity to influenza 7 virus could predispose to life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Additional genes 8 (SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, XCR1, IL6, CTSL, ABO, and FURIN) and 9 HLA alleles have also been implicated in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. 10 Currently, Brazil has recorded the third-highest number of COVID-19 patients worldwide. 11 We aim to investigate the genetic variation present in COVID-19-related genes in the 12 Brazilian population. We analysed 27 candidate genes and HLA alleles in 954 admixed 13 Brazilian exomes. We used the information available in two public databases 14 (http:\/\/www.bipmed.org and http:\/\/abraom.ib.usp.br\/), and additional exomes from 15 individuals born in southeast Brazil, the region with the highest number of COVID-19 16 patients in the country. Variant allele frequencies were compared with the 1000 Genomes 17 Project phase 3 (1KGP) and the gnomAD databases. We found 395 non-synonymous 18 variants; of these, 325 were also found in the 1000 Genome Project phase 3 (1KGP) and\/or 19 gnomAD. Six of these variants were previously reported as putatively influencing the rate 20 of infection or clinical prognosis for COVID-19.

Our results showed genetic variability 1 common to other populations, but also rare and ultra-rare variants exclusively found in the 2 Brazilian population. These findings could potentially lead to differences in the rate of 3 infection or response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and should be further investigated in 4 patients with the disease. 5 6 7","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows a wide variation in expression and severity of symptoms, from very mild or no symptoms, to flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even death. Large differences in outcome have also been observed between males and females. The causes for this variability are likely to be multifactorial, and to include genetics. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the infection depends on two human genes: the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell invasion, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. Genetic variation in these two genes may thus modulate an individual's genetic predisposition to infection and virus clearance. While genetic data on COVID-19 patients is being gathered, we carried out a phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS) to investigate the role of these genes in other human phenotypes in the general population. We examined 178 quantitative phenotypes including cytokines and cardio-metabolic biomarkers, as well as usage of 58 medications in 36,339 volunteers from the Lifelines population cohort, in relation to 1,273 genetic variants located in or near ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While none reached our threshold for significance, we observed several interesting suggestive associations. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the TMPRSS2 genes were associated with thrombocytes count (p = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ). SNPs within the ACE2 gene were associated with (1) the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) combination therapies (p = 5.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), an association that is significantly stronger in females (p dif f = 0.01), and (2) with the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (p = 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). While these associations need to be confirmed in larger sample sizes, they suggest that these variants could play a role in diseases such as Lopera Maya et al. PheWAS at ACE2 and TMPRSS2 thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and chronic inflammation that are often observed in the more severe COVID-19 cases. Further investigation of these genetic variants in the context of COVID-19 is thus promising for better understanding of disease variability.

A few hundred patients were detected with multiple viral strainrepresenting mutations simultaneously, which may stand for possible co-infection or potential homogenous recombination of SARS-CoV-2 in environment or within the viral host. Interestingly nucleotide substitutions among SARS-CoV-2 genomes tended to switch between bat RaTG13 coronavirus sequence and Wuhan-Hu-1 genome, indicating the higher genetic instability or tolerance of mutations on those sites or suggesting that major viral strains might exist between Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 coronavirus."]},

However, most of the current COVID-19 clinical practices and trials do not take sex as consideration. We performed an unbiased sex-based comparative analysis for the clinical outcomes, peripheral immune cells, and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels of 1,558 males and 1,499 females COVID-19 patients from a single center. The lymphocyte subgroups were measured by Flow cytometry. Total antibody, Spike protein (S)-, receptor binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)-specific IgM and IgG levels were measured by chemiluminescence. We found that the mortality and ICU admission rates were approximately 2-fold higher in males than that in females (P<0.005). Survival analysis revealed that sex is an independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 (Hazard ratio=2.2, P=0.003). The concentration of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood was significantly higher in males. Besides, the renal and hepatic abnormality induced by COVID-19 was more common in males during the hospitalization. The analysis of lymphocyte subsets revealed that the percentage of CD19+ B cell and CD4+ T cell was significantly higher in females (P<0.001) during hospitalization, indicating the stronger humoral immunity in females than males. Notably, the protective IgG sharply increased and reached a peak in the fourth week after symptom onset in females, while gradually increased and reached a peak in the seventh week in males.","Objective: To compare the difference of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female COVID-19 patients and figure out a possible explanation for different outcome between male and female patients. Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed. The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase. The inconsistent of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody generation in male and female patients may account for the different outcome of COVID-19 between gender.","As expected, FCV-19S, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 demonstrated significant concurrent correlations. Females reported higher levels of COVID-19-related fear and reported more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with men. Younger respondents (aged 18\u201330) reported less fear and depressive symptomatology than the other age categories, but they did not present any differences with regard to anxiety symptoms. There were no significant correlations between other sociodemographic characteristics and the psychometric scales ( Table 7 ).","A male bias in COVID\u201019 mortality was reported early during the pandemic 25 ,  26 ,  27  and has been confirmed worldwide in a recent meta\u2010analysis. 28  One of the hypotheses to explain this is differences in adaptive immunity between males and females. Although the mean serum RBD\u2010S IgG reactivity level appeared higher in male samples (O.D. = 1.8, n = 17) than in female samples (O.D. = 1.0, n = 15), this difference was not significant and the same maximum reactivity values were found in males and females (Figure 2a). Similarly, anti\u2010spike IgG endpoint titres trended higher in male patients compared to female patients, but this difference was not significant (Figure 2b).","In conclusion, several reports point to the sex and gender differences in COVID-19 outcomes. Though the current evidence does not suggest a sex or gender difference COVID-19 infection, male patients tend to have both higher severity and fatality rates. These disparities may be due to higher levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, as well as hormonal influences on the immune response. Gender differences in behavior can also contribute to the greater severity and fatality in COVID-19 observed among men. Men tend to make up a greater proportion of smokers and patients with COVID-19-associated comorbidities, while also being less likely to seek out medical health for illness. The combination of these factors could lead to poorer COVID-19 outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 relies on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to enter the body; thus, treatment targeting the levels of these proteins could be possible therapies for COVID-19 infection. Supplementing ACE2 levels in the body through treatment with soluble ACE2 may be able to mitigate severe symptoms, while TMPRSS2 inhibitors can prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry altogether. Treatment with estrogen has been shown to increase ACE2 levels, but further research needs to be done regarding its effectiveness in COVID-19 cases. Understanding of these sex and gender differences is necessary, as it can help identify vulnerable populations and develop specific and effective therapeutic strategies."]},

N\u00e9d\u00e9lec et al., report that 9.3% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and in Black Africans, there may be a more potent inflammatory response to infection137 , 138. To support this, a cross-sectional study of 508 Black and White adults demonstrated significantly higher IL-6 and CRP levels amongst the Black participants139. Furthermore, patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are explicitly warned about heightened risks during the current pandemic situation140, and there is mounting concern amongst the BAME population as SCD affects predominantly Black Africans141. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been well characterized in SCD142, and within the context of a superimposed COVID-19 infection, may contribute towards an increased risk of sickle-cell crises, coagulopathy, systemic vasculopathy, and functional asplenia related immunocompromise140.","It appears that the variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that such variants are not associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst patients who develop severe COVID-19. In contrast there were small deviations in the penetrance of some of the SNPs identified in different co-morbidity cohorts. While the pattern of these deviations were similar across cardiovascular, diabetes and hypertension co-morbidity cohorts, the pattern across the respiratory co-morbidity cohort was somewhat different. These differences, while suggestive of the need for further study, were not yet significant enough to be reported in detail.","It is acknowledged that direct information on the influence of CCR5 polymorphisms on COVID-19 disease severity is very limited at the moment. Moreover, mechanistic studies providing plausible explanations on how polymorphisms in CCR5 and other related genes would correlate with the disease severity and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including the recruitment of immune cells\/inflammatory cells to the infection sites, are needed. Nevertheless, with the discovery of potential host genomic factors associated with COVID-19 and knowledge already gained from other global infectious diseases, there is now a greater potential to improve clinical management and foster better patient outcomes.","During our review of genes potentially involved in the COVID-19 response, we excluded genes differentially expressed in patients such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes whose polymorphisms were not proven to be associated with severe COVID-19 (Wen et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Bilinska et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020) because we wanted our study to be restricted to genes with mutations involved directly in association with the severe disease.","In this study, we explore the physiological significance of the COVID-19 severity associated genetic variants using detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics data from large cohorts. Our findings allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy. A recent genome-wide association study of European ancestry has identified 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 (ABO gene) to be significantly associated with COVID-19 respiratory failure (1). Here, we employed the detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics data of the Human Functional Genomics Projects (HFGP) to explore the physiological significance of the host genetic variants that influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. A functional genomics investigation based on functional characterization of individuals with high genetic risk for severe COVID-19 susceptibility identified several major patterns: i. a large impact of genetically determined innate immune responses in COVID-19, with increased susceptibility for severe disease in individuals with defective monocyte-derived cytokine production; ii. genetic susceptibility related to ABO blood groups is probably mediated through the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelial dysfunction; and iii. the increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 in men is at least partially mediated by chromosome X-mediated genetic variation. These insights allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy."]},

Prolonged exposure to this urban traffic-related air pollutant may be an important risk factor of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths.","Both air pollution and COVID-19 are well-documented to cause or exacerbate respiratory health problems.

The available research findings on this topic may help the epidemiologists to select a proper measure to prevent such an outbreak in the future. Attention should also be paid to the poor communities, who are susceptible to be exposed to indoor air pollution, contributing to a greater risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19 infections. Air quality should be counted as an important part of an integrated approach toward public health protection and prevention to the spread of epidemics.

{"body":"Which SARS-CoV-2 protein is most promising for vaccine development?","type":"factoid","id":"5fd4439c30a653d77d000069","answerReady":true,"snippets":["Motivated by the promising results of SOSIP-NVP, we sought to apply the NVP technology for COVID-19 vaccine development. According to previous studies, the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the interaction with ACE2 receptors on the human cells which leads to viral infection. Inducing antibody response against S protein therefore is an effective strategy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [26,27]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the functional region within the S protein that engages ACE2, and has been suggested as a great target for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 [28,29]. In addition, our analysis on genetic sequence comparison between SARS-CoV-2 variants reported on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as of August 2020 and the original SARS-CoV-2 that appeared in Wuhan in 2019 indicated high conservation of RBD genetic sequence, compared with other genetic regions (Fig. 6a-b), thus highlighting RBD as a promising target for COVID-19 vaccine development.","COVID-19 is a worldwide emergency; therefore, there is a critical need for foundational knowledge about B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 essential for vaccine development. However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176-206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease. Finally, these predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this high priority virus.","Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other coronavirus S proteinbased vaccines to be successful, e.g., prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S2) increased the ratio of neutralizing versus nonneutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of the S protein. Furthermore, the wild-type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage needed for a natively folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild-type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was polarized towards Th1 IFN-\u03b3. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04436276). npj Vaccines (2020) 5:91 ; https:\/\/doi.","An important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for SARS-cOV-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms, including nucleic acids (dNA and RNA), virus-like particles, peptides, viral vector (replicative and non-replicative), recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses.

Our reverse vaccinology in silico approach also supports that S protein is the best vaccine candidate protein. In addition, probable secreted orf7a, orf8, and nsp-10 proteins with signal peptide can be promising vaccine candidates. Epitopes predicted in S protein and other proteins having a signal peptide may have a potential neutralising effect and can be used to develop an epitope-based peptide vaccine or a serodiagnostic assay. In the future, in addition to the currently studied S protein, antigenicity of orf7a, orf8, and nsp-10 proteins as well as significant epitopes selected in this study should be checked by wet lab studies and antigenic proteins\/epitopes should be studied as vaccine or serodiagnostic candidates.","The spike protein, together with the M and E proteins, is anchored into the viral envelope, decorating the virion surface as a distinctive crown (\"corona\") ( Fig. 1A) , and is essential for viral entry into target cells [15, 16] . As it induces neutralizing antibody responses, S-protein is also an important target for vaccine development [17, 18] , and therefore it has been studied extensively [19] [20] [21] .","Internal influenza proteins are attractive vaccine candidates since they are more conserved than the external glycoproteins [124]. This may result in broader cross-protection induced by the vaccine. One example is FP-01.1, a peptide-based vaccine which includes several CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes conjugated to a fluorocarbon chain. These epitopes are derived from internal influenza proteins including NP, M1, polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and polymerase basic 2 (PB2). Four trials were performed in the past decade utilizing 328 participants 18\u201374 years old. One phase I trial demonstrated that vaccination with FP-01.1 induced strong cellular responses in 75% of participants with a median response of 243 spot forming cells (SFC)\/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as measured using IFN\u03b3 ELISpot assay [65]. This cellular response was activated against several heterologous H1N1 and H3N2 strains indicating broad cross-reactivity [65]. Another UIV targeting internal proteins is OVX836, which is a recombinant NP vaccine. In preclinical trials, vaccinated mice were protected against three lethal influenza A virus (IAV) challenges and induced stronger immunogenicity than wild-type NP alone [118]. Protection was further improved if mice were immunized with a combination of the seasonal inactivated vaccine and OVX836.","Viral vectors can generate high levels of recombinant protein expression providing the basis for modern vaccine development. A large number of different viral vector expression systems have been utilized for targeting viral surface proteins and tumor-associated antigens. Immunization studies in preclinical animal models have evaluated the elicited humoral and cellular responses and the possible protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious pathogens or tumor cells. Several vaccine candidates for both infectious diseases and various cancers have been subjected to a number of clinical trials. Human immunization trials have confirmed safe application of viral vectors, generation of neutralizing antibodies and protection against challenges with lethal doses. A special emphasis is placed on COVID-19 vaccines based on viral vectors. Likewise, the flexibility and advantages of applying viral particles, RNA replicons and DNA replicon vectors of self-replicating RNA viruses for vaccine development are presented.","Scenario b: Starting from both viral proteins and a list of proteins of interest, we can use CoVex to identify a connecting pathway or biological mechanisms that can be targeted by drugs. In this scenario, we are specifically interested in viral proteins that suppress host immunity and the corresponding host immune response pathways. First, we select the viral proteins ORF7a and ORF3a, which are potentially involved in innate immune response and apoptosis as discussed by Gordon et al.10. Next, we compile a list of proteins of interest based on the DEGs from the study by Blanco-Melo et al.19 lung epithelial cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to altered expression of immunity-related genes to combat the viral infection. We consider DEGs known to be associated with the host pathway involving infection with the herpes simplex virus, another viral pathogen. These genes include IFIH1, OAS1, STAT1, DDX58, OAS2, OAS3, IRF7, EIF2AK2, IFIT1, and IRF9. The selected viral proteins and DEGs (converted to Uniprot ids) were used as seeds for the multi-Steiner tree algorithm to extract a potential immune-related mechanism. As expected, the resulting subnetwork reveals that the viral proteins are close to the DEGs in the host PPI network. Closeness centrality analysis assigned a high rank to Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib, which are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib exert immunomodulatory effects as Janus kinase inhibitors20,21. Thus, administration with these drugs may mitigate immune-mediated lung injury and reduce functional deterioration caused by an overamplified host inflammatory response. This could be especially important in later stages of the disease to prevent an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system and, hence, may further prevent the need for mechanical ventilation in patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Other drugs that target this subnetwork include Masitinib, Erlotinib, and Sorafenib, which could be further examined in downstream analyses. In a similar manner, users may provide a custom list of proteins as seeds to hunt for drugs that can target a putative mechanism of interest."]},

In this review, we provide a scientific view on the potential role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 virus\/COVID-19 disease. Vitamin D is well-known to play a significant role in maintaining the immune health of an individual. Moreover, it induces antimicrobial peptide expression that can decrease viral replication and regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory\/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, supplementation of vitamin D has the potential to reduce the incidence, severity and the risk of death from pneumonia resulting from the cytokine storm of many viral infections including COVID-19. We suggest that supplementation of subjects at high risk of COVID-19 with vitamin D (1.000 to 3.000 IU) to maintain its optimum serum concentrations may be of significant benefit for both in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.","This succinct but comprehensive review of the evidence found that despite almost complete absence of official government guidelines favoring vitamin D supplements to potentially decrease COVID-19 risk and severity, support among clinicians and other researchers for correcting and preventing vitamin D deficiency with modest daily vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic is very strong, worldwide. The evidence supports recommending 2,000 IU (50 mcg) vitamin D daily for at-risk teens and adults, which is well within safe limits and might dramatically reduce COVID-19 fatalities.","The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this study was 90% and only 1 patient (10%) had vitamin D insufficiency. There are many health benefits of vitamin D and very few adverse effects. A hypothetical review showed that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for COVID-19. Another randomized controlled trials need to determine and evaluate this recommendation in preventing or treating COVID-19. Clinicians should continue to treat people with vitamin D deficiency especially in managing COVID-19 patients. Ethics approval and consent to participate Ethical clearance certificate was obtained from Bethesda Hospital Yogyakarta; ethical clearance certificate number 18 (EC\/18\/2020). Authorization from Bethesda Hospital was obtained to conduct this study. All patients' privacy and confidentiality were strictly observed throughout the study.","In conclusion, the evidence presented here supports further observational and multicenter well-designed randomized clinical studies on the role of vitamin D in preventing and\/or treating COVID-19 infections. The overlap in the vitamin D associated biological pathways with the dysregulation reported to drive COVID-19 outcomes warrants further investigation, as does the role that vitamin D levels at time of presentation of COVID-19 may have as predictive biomarkers of disease severity. It is important for future work that implications for at-risk populations (BAME, elderly, pregnant, immunocompromised, obese) are taken into consideration when defining the vitamin D dose regimens and duration. Moreover, clinical trials focused on inpatients presenting with COVID-19 are needed to provide a better understanding of the potential of vitamin D as an adjunct treatment.","Vitamin D deficiency co-exists in patients with COVID-19. At this time, dark skin color, increased age, the presence of pre-existing illnesses and vitamin D deficiency are features of severe COVID disease. Of these, only vitamin D deficiency is modifiable. Through its interactions with a multitude of cells, vitamin D may have several ways to reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infections and COVID-19: reducing the survival and replication of viruses, reducing risk of inflammatory cytokine production, increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 concentrations, and maintaining endothelial integrity. Fourteen observational studies offer evidence that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. The evidence to date generally satisfies Hill's criteria for causality in a biological system, namely, strength of association, consistency, temporality, biological gradient, plausibility (e.g., mechanisms), and coherence, although experimental verification is lacking. Thus, the evidence seems strong enough that people and physicians can use or recommend vitamin D supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19 in light of their safety and wide therapeutic window. In view of public health policy, however, results of large-scale vitamin D randomized controlled trials are required and are currently in progress."]},

For the male sex, the largest mortality rate occurred for the 65\u201369 and 50\u201354-year age range, with 9.03% of the total deaths, followed by the 55\u201359 and 45\u201349-year ranges, with 8.76% and 8.55%, respectively. For the female sex, the age ranges with the highest mortality rates were the 65\u201369-year age range (4.67%) and the 55\u201359-year range (4.24%). The female sex presented 579 cases, thereby showing a lower lethality rate in women to date. At present, COVID-19 has a lethality rate of 9.67% in Mexico, which is higher than the worldwide rate of 7%.","The United States: The US COVID-19 cases rose to more than 1.8 million, with more than 105,000 deaths as of 30 May 2020. The CFR of Italy was 2.5 times higher than that of the US (Table 1). Of the 81,372 deaths having age distribution available in the US (Table 3), more than 80% were 65 years or older, and only 2.5% were younger than age 45. PYLL due to COVID-19 in the US surpassed any other countries. The total PYLL due to COVID-19 was 245,246, 408,781, and 572,316 person-years before reaching age 70, 75, and 80 years, respectively. When the total PYLL figures were compared, the person-year loss in the US was 6 times higher than those of Italy for the age limits of 70 and 75, but about 4 times higher when age 80 was used as the upper limit. The standardized PYLL measurements provided similarly higher rates in the US compared with Italy (Figure 1). However, the crude PYLLs before standardization in the US were only 4 units (person-years\/100,000) higher at age 70, 14 units higher at age 75, and 46 units lower at age 80, compared with those of Italy, indicating that standardized rates provide more meaningful information for cross-country comparisons.","The age distribution of the COVID-19 study group was analyzed and it was observed that the mean age of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 68.26 y (SD 13.609) (Figure 2), being slightly higher for females (70.2 y) compared to males (67.1 y). Out of the 814 patients studied, 740 deaths (90.9%) occurred to those over 50 y. The percentages for each age group can be found in the description of Figure 2 below."]},

However, attitudes regarding physical contact was low in the Makkah region, which necessitates greater effort in educating and warning people about the risks. ","The present study suggests that social distancing could decrease the incidence and mortality related to COVID-19. Thus, it is necessary to continue these measures, because if the government plan to reduce the social distancing measures the occurrence of the next waves of the epidemic will be inevitable. ","We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic using a simple susceptible-infected-removed epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementary approach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable subpopulation may provide a more efficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe resulting in a collectively immune population.","By the start of April 2020, the majority of people living in the United States were under orders to dramatically restrict their daily activities in order to reduce transmission of the virus that can cause COVID-19. These strong social distancing measures will be effective in controlling the spread of the virus only if they are able to reduce the amount of close interpersonal contact in a population. It is therefore crucial for researchers and policymakers to empirically measure the extent to which these policies have actually reduced interpersonal interaction. We","The absence of an effective vaccine and the lack of immunity against COVID-19 have made social distancing a largely feasible and widely adopted approach to controlling the ongoing pandemic. Maintaining social distancing has also been recommended by leading health organizations, such as the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To this end, our proposed deep learning-based video surveillance framework will play a significant role in combating the spread of COVID-19 in a sustainable smart city context. At this stage, it is imperative to identify some of the potential impact of our approach on the surrounding environments, such as increased anxiety and panic among the individuals who receive the repetitive alerts. In addition, some legitimate concerns regarding individual rights and privacy could be raised, and can be effectively handled by obtaining prior consent from individuals and concealing their identities."]},

Tests of a CoV-229E laboratory strain under conditions that simulated the ambient light, temperature, and relative humidity conditions of the classroom revealed that some of the virus remained viable on various surfaces for 7 days, suggesting CoV-229E is relatively stable in the environment. Our findings reinforce the notion that contact transmission may be possible for this virus.","Furthermore, de Sousa et al. (2014) perform the test in the laboratory for coronavirus laboratory testing on coronavirus and revealed that virus was stable for 5 days on a smooth surface in between \u221225 \u00b0C to 22 \u00b0C but its visibility swiftly vanished at high temperature e.g. 38 \u00b0C and above. van Doremalen et al.

Therefore, further laboratory testing and experiments are also dire need to be done further strengthen of this myth (Corman et al., 2012; de Sousa et al., 2014; Shahkarami et al., 2015) . In","Several investigations have shown that human coronaviruses such as endemic HCoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-1 may persist on inert\/inanimate surfaces from some hours to a few days (Kampf et al., 2020a). Therefore, it might be expected that SARS-CoV-2 could show a similar behavior than SARS-CoV-1, the most closely related human coronavirus. In the early months of the current pandemic, the surface stability of the new coronavirus was already assessed. Thus, van Dorelamen et al. (2020) reported that fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was plausible, with the virus being able to remain infectious on surfaces up to days, a time that would depend on the inoculum shed. In recent months, various studies on the stability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 on inert surfaces have been conducted (Biryukov et al., 2020; Carraturo et al., 2020; Chin et al., 2020; Colaneri et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020). All of them agree with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 can last on different surfaces for times ranging from hours to a few days. The maximum time would correspond to materials such as stainless steel, plastic and carboard (van Dorelamen et al., 2020). In contrast, on copper surfaces the coronavirus can only sustain approximately 4 h (Suman et al., 2020). Interestingly, a rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is possible by using commonly available chemicals and biocides on inanimate surfaces (Akram, 2020; Dev Kumar et al., 2020; Gerlach et al., 2020). In summary, although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces is possible, washing hands and regular disinfection practices should reduce the possibilities of transmission of the coronavirus by this potential route of infection.","Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days. Surface disinfection with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite or 62\u201371% ethanol significantly reduces coronavirus infectivity on surfaces within 1 min exposure time. We expect a similar effect against the SARS-CoV-2."]},
{"body":"How does each of the current vaccines undergoing evaluation worldwide work?","type":"summary","id":"5fce677330a653d77d00005f","answerReady":false,"snippets":["In the eleven months elapsed since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its genome, an exceptional effort by the scientific community has led to the development of over 300 vaccine projects. Over 40 are now undergoing clinical evaluation, ten of these are in Phase III clinical trials, three of them have ended Phase III with positive results. A few of these new vaccines are being approved for emergency use. Existing data suggest that new vaccine candidates may be instrumental in protecting individuals and reducing the spread of pandemic. The conceptual and technological platforms exploited are diverse, and it is likely that different vaccines will show to be better suited to distinct groups of the human population. Moreover, it remains to be elucidated whether and to what extent the capacity of vaccines under evaluation and of unrelated vaccines such as BCG can increase immunological fitness by training innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and pathogenagnostic protection. Due to the short development time and the novelty of the technologies adopted, these vaccines will be deployed with several unresolved issues that only the passage of time will permit to clarify. Technical problems connected with the production of billions of doses and ethical ones connected with the availably of these vaccines also in the poorest countries, are imminent challenges facing us. It is our tenet that in the long run more than one vaccine will be needed to ensure equitable global access, protection of diverse subjects and immunity against viral variants.","There are over a hundred vaccines being developed throughout the world, and the race to be the first effective vaccine has fueled the rapid development of both preclinical and currently utilized vaccine approaches. There is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution as each vaccine strategy has both advantages and disadvantages. Of the leading companies, Moderna, BioNTech\/Pfizer, and Inovio are producing nucleic acid based vaccines, and early studies from Moderna and BioNTech\/Pfizer generated strong antibody. Ad-based vaccines remain early frontrunners as well, with Oxford\/Astrazeneca and CanSino likewise publishing favorable early data. Other state-run institutions and companies such as the Gamaleya Research Institute and Sinopharm have advanced further into their respective Phases of clinical trials and have been granted emergency use by their respective countries. Due to the generation of so many vaccines within many different countries, there will potentially be more than one effective vaccine, and it is crucial that effective vaccines are distributed to all parts of the world to generate global herd immunity. Regardless of the first developer, it is of truly noteworthy importance that the global effort to develop, test, produce, and distribute effective vaccines is being done so rapidly. Success in this effort will not only lead to an end to the pandemic, but what is learned will aid in future research and development efforts as well as the implementation of previously unused vaccine types for future diseases.","Researchers around the world are racing for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and novel therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. Typically, the clinical development of a vaccine proceeds with small phase I trials for safety evaluation through formal toxicology testing in humans, followed by phase II trials through dosage formulation and phase III trials, in which the efficacy and safety of a vaccine are evaluated in a larger group. All of the therapeutics and vaccines also must be tested in an appropriate animal model before human trials. However, in this case, it has to be noted that the virus does not grow and infect wild-type mice, which has been shown to exhibit only mild clinical symptoms [86] . Despite all the odds, consolidated efforts on research are the only way forward as the world awaits successful trials of therapies and vaccines to fight this pandemic and prepare for the next ones.","Researchers around the world are racing for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and novel therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19.

In response to this urgent global health crisis, a massive effort is under way to develop vaccines for coronavirus within months and make it available to save lives. Several candidate vaccines strategies are being investigated in laboratories of universities and companies in many parts of the world. Of the over 130 vaccine candidates, 17 are already in clinical trials, while the others are in various stages of preclinical development. Each of the different vaccine platforms available, traditional or novel, is currently being explored. Some platforms, such as DNA and RNA vaccines, have not produced licensed vaccines but may prove to be the first one to reach the finish line. Three vaccine candidates, one each from the US, UK, and China, have completed Phase I. While vaccine efficacy of the candidates is still under evaluation, there have been few or no adverse reactions in humans. Not a single vaccine has been approved for any other coronavirus so far, and there is no guarantee that a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be available soon. Robust and well-designed trials in populations with ongoing outbreaks in multiple locations and international collaborations are necessary to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines."]},

Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. we use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30. This estimation gives a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population, as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources in health.","Quarantine for COVID-19 is hard and could safely be made easier. Lengthy quarantine is difficult for many individuals to rigorously observe. To date, 14 days has been recommended as the quarantine period for people who are exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case, because most infections appear by then. For household close contacts, there remains a 0.5% chance","The number of imported cases increased dramatically after 11 March 2020, when COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic (Figure 5). The mandatory 14-day home quarantine was extended to all travellers from all countries on 19 March 2020. This measure kept all travellers from high-risk areas confined to their homes under close monitoring, and prevented them from moving around in their communities. After implementation of this measure, most of the imported cases were contained in home quarantine or home isolation before they were identified (Figure 5).","Quarantine duration ranged from <2 weeks at 6.6% to more than 4 weeks at 35.4%. Nearly 38.2% used to spend between 6 and 10 h outside the home before quarantine, 20.7% spent <2 h, and only 13.6% spent more than 10 h (see Table 3 for more details).","In the first scenario, it is assumed that no additional public health interventions are implemented, other than those already reflected by the data up to 29 March (day 35), which would then be fully maintained throughout the control period, and the epidemy should evolve from that date, under the parameters above identified. Figure 5 has already shown the evolution of the accumulated and instantaneous reported, CR(t) and R(t), unreported, CU(t) and U(t), infectious individuals, up to 150 days. Due to the fairly low value of f(t) starting with f0\u22480.30 and dropping to fmax\u22480.16, in light of the fairly low number of PCR kits made available and other implementation difficulties during this initial phase, the accumulated number of reported infectious cases is quite low with respect to the unreported ones, as already discussed. No predictions on casualties are here proposed, since these are highly dependent on age structure, social-economic conditions, and health system response. It should be recalled that this initial period of 35 days reflects the strict initial quarantine that was applied at least at the most affected regions, starting in day 21, which is confirmed through the global mobility reports [29,30]. However, these are ideal conditions that would be rather unlikely to be enforced for a much longer period, due to the sociological and economic characteristics of the country. As will be discussed more closely in what follows, the available mobility reports later on made available have in fact clearly indicated that especially after the Easter holiday weekend (day 50 and on), the circulation was progressively increased in average terms within the country, despite the quarantine measures retained by most of the federation states."]}
